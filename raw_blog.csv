5,"If you're going to get stuck in an airport for any length of time then I can recommend Schiphol. Spacious and plenty of facilities, I spent several hours reading, writing and (after the purchase of a pair of headphones) some listening. Also some people watching. Fascinating to see so many people in their late teens or early twenties dressed with references to the 60s and 70s. One girl even had one of those freak flag pendents swinging around her neck."
6,There was also a big shoal of pollock at about 8 meters. I think this particular shoal was the reason so many seals were around.
7,"The wonder of playing with Barbie dolls was that I got to make up awesome stories and play them out with my dolls. My Barbies got into all kinds of shenanigans, they traveled all over the world and some even lived under the sea. My Barbies also dressed like rockstars and drove a convertible (they always drove a convertible, ’cause I didn’t own another Barbie sized car). And most of all, my Barbies always had top-notch mansions, which took literally days for me to fashion and perfect."
8,"Anyway...back to Charlie... Since Jen was gone for the week and Jeremy had to work, Charlie came to stay with Grammy. I had so much to do but I'm telling you, there is nothing I wouldn't do for this child so everything else took a back seat to my little Smooshy! She is now almost 8 months old and just getting cuter and cuter. So much fun and so quick to smile. She's also becoming very mobile... crawling all over the place. She actually pulled herself up while she was in the pack and play so I had to take the top bed piece out. She had a bit of a cold while she was here and as much I hate her being sick I loved that she only wanted to be with Grammy at times when she was tired. Speaking of tired, I was worn out! This is why people my age don't have babies. Thank goodness for Grampy, Auntie Julz and Uncle Nate taking turns with Charlie, giving me a chance to make dinner, straighten up or just collapse! Special props to Julz who had Charlie just screaming with laughter. I wish I had been able to get video. Charlie and I were sitting on the bed and Julz would run and flip over and off the bed, jump up and say ""Ta Da!"" and Charlie would just crack up... Julianne is so smitten with this child. She said ""I would do ANYTHING to make her smile."" How adorable is that? And Charlie loves her right back. Here she is giving Auntie Julz baby kisses!"
9,"Who is Hawkeye? If you haven't read many Avengers comics, you might not have a good handle on his character. After all, he has never been able to support a solo book, he's never been a particularly prolific guest star, and he hasn't really done much of anything in the last ten years other than die and come back as a ninja (sigh). But it's absolutely vital to understand two things about him: 1) he's not Green Arrow and 2) he's kind of an asshole."

13,"Of course there was more to do in my free time than just mindless killing, joyous as it was. One of my favorite ways to make money was by playing taxi driver. Just jack a taxi, kill the driver and start picking up fares. It was a great way to rack up cash, especially since GTAIII was far more generous with the green than later GTA titles would be. Making quick cash early on in GTAIII was never a problem."
14,"Thus you will need to take the general principles in this book and apply them to your own enterprise. Without working close­ly with you, we can’t identify for you the best social media goals, strategies, sites, and techniques for your business.

While the other players each get to control a Player Character (PC) who is their in-game alter ego. All real basic stuff for roleplaying games really but it no one says it how are there supposed to be new players coming into the hobby."
17,"It's very much my opinion that women are often toxic towards other women in all walks of life, and it's something I work very hard on myself as I will admit that, as I've got a fairly unique territory, my knee jerk reaction is often to jealously guard it - which I then stop myself doing unless it's justified."

19,"Instead, Mr. Cosby focuses on issues that many of the African Americans he makes reference to are already fully aware of, but that cannot make the necessary changes to escape the circle of stereotypes because they lack the resources to do so."
20,"Got seen? No problem. This is when factors beyond your control come into play. Transportation is the best route. Own a car? It's winter. ""My starter wouldn't turn over for a bit. I flooded the engine and had to wait awhile till it turned"" or ""My car wouldn't start and I had to wait for a friend to drive over and give me a jump"". Using public transit? Even better. ""Traffic was terrible"", ""The bus just kept going and I can't afford a taxi"", ""My friend/family who drives me sent me a text message canceling 5 minutes before I was to leave"", ""The bus didn't count my change correctly and the driver said I couldn't go on even though I KNOW I had the right amount! So I had to convince the next driver to let me on""."
21,"What does it mean when we use the vagina – something that’s flexible, self-cleaning, and can “take a pounding” (as Betty White has been quoted to say), not to mention the vessel through which lifeblood and the next members of the human race come tumbling out – as a means to humiliate people?"

Make sure that you will schedule fitting and will give time for the adjustments of your gown. Considering the body type when choosing wedding dresses will help you to go for the right one.

44,There also seems to be some people out there searching for a ‘mystical room’ and let’s be honest…who isn’t? Mine is in a place full of pillows and silence and there is no one there complaining that the cookies are gone because the cookies are never gone.

The pile of logs was to his left, just by the dirt track that went around the lone building and to his right was a ramshackle log shed where the unused fire wood from last winter lay strewn about. Beyond the yard was the raw of the tall maple trees he saw from out front and beyond the maple trees a forest with a small clearing where he spied several deer grazing in the tall meadow grass. The late afternoon air smelled fresh, woodsy and, Obediah thought, of marzipan. Obadiah rolled up his sleeves and got stuck into chopping wood."

Physical exercise is crucial during this time to keep things moving. Continue to be in relationship and community. The worst thing you can do is to disappear into your turtle shell or dark hole.

It is also allows the government to use the information in myriad ways, including those not necessarily tied to cybersecurity.

Patients who I haven’t seen previously but had a good experience are usually very cooperative in their care and understand the benefits of physical therapy, as it has helped them sometime in the past. It is my hope to build on their previous good experience, showing them how physical therapy, and more specifically, my approach to physical therapy, will help in returning them to a pain-free and fully functional life. If they have had a bad experience in physical therapy they usually look at me with scepticism, thinking that since physical therapy didn’t work for them the first time around that it won’t be any different this time. This makes my job a little harder. I hope that by providing a thorough evaluation and explanation of their condition as well as being professional yet approachable that I will knock down some of the barriers the patient my have from their previous experiences."

They are more aware, more active, less in need of a super warm brooder and more messy (I didn’t think that was possible, but because ducks need water to be able to eat their duck chow, they manage to get water all over the place. And their poops are a lot more liquidy – and so messier as well). I plan on getting them out of the stock tank brooder I have them in in about another week. Then I will pen them into a horse stall, with lots of bedding and a brood lamp in the corner, and they can run around and make all the mess they want. I’m feeding them chicken starter, but with extra niacin in the water (100 mg of people niacin dissolved into a gallon of water) as they have a higher need for niacin for the first two weeks."

146,"Now that I think about it, the college talk was not unlike the sex talk. (I guess the key difference between the college talk and the sex talk that I had with my mother is that we never actually had a sex talk, except for that fateful evening when she told me to “cover myself in latex” in the event of “sexual contact”). In that heart-felt one-sided diatribe shared between a mother and her daughter, I learned the facts of life. College was the vehicle by which civilization as we knew it persevered."

Debt bondage is the repayment of debt through the provision of services e.g. labour in agriculture, brick kiln work, cotton-seed production, tanning, mining and carpet weaving industries. Again these are industries in the informal sector, which is why this system can lend itself to abuse and the system amounts to no less than slavery. Debt bondage continues to exist despite being outlawed in a number of legislations, and can end up spreading over generations so children inherit the debt and are born in to slavery."

This Emanuelle (Laura Gemser), a fashion photographer and freelance journalist, approaches both jobs with a fiery passion. The latter in particular, as it requires her to throw herself headfirst, or, in most cases, cuntfirst, into all sorts of dangerous and lascivious situations. Equipped only with a tiny camera she hides inside a gaudy necklace, her svelte frame (which I'm sure tastes like freshly squeezed molasses on the morning of your gothic bat mitzvah), and a figurative goblet filled to the brim with moxie, Emanuelle uses her connections to get the dish on all kinds of shady business."

While a straight comparison of earnings may not be able to show the difference in earnings for a specific worker, Brookings researchers used regression analysis to identify specific job characteristics to provide a more meaningful comparison. When this analysis was done, manufacturing workers realized wages that were 8.4 % higher than those of non-manufacturing workers. In fact, workers at all levels, regardless of race, gender, and education earned more in manufacturing than in other industries with one exception (Hispanics earned 10 cents less in manufacturing than in non-manufacturing). In addition, to higher wages, manufacturing industries are more likely to provide employee benefits like retirement plans, health insurance, paid holiday and vacation."

Next came Konar Wuldcarva who shook Hermel’s hand somewhat awkwardly. A thin man with a narrow face and light brown hair introduced himself as Selig Courtsman. He had frosty blue eyes and wore a wry smile. There was another man with an austere expression, close cropped hair, and wore a tunic on which was emblazoned the symbol of the Elkron of the Sun, Eldrik. He gave a courteous bow of the head, and indicated he was interested in listening to the proposed adventure. This man was named Star of Justice, but he did not introduce himself. He simply stood and listened intently. Lastly, a redish metallic tinged grasshopper landed on Rothomon’s desk. Hermel looked over and thought to swat the insect before it leapt away. However, before he did so, Rothmon stayed his hand with a quick intercession of his hand on Hermel’s arm."

There’s a cop that Rin uses for information and we see him age roughly 50 years over the course of the series. The producers do a great job of using this time jump to give you a sense of all the stories we haven’t seen. Rin runs a private detective agency and where Koki is a frazzled, scared kid in the first episode (he’s actually a clone), he’s a contributing member of the team in the second story. That we don’t get to see his development is a shame, but that would take 20 episodes and for this jumping ahead in time approach, it works."

But here I am right in the heart of the great tension in our country. The attention lavished on the occupy movement again has payoff for those operating peripherally to the scene. The copper cowboys have stripped another west or east side apartment, business, church, school, of all its copper plumbing and wiring, to sell off the the tune of black market gold, again. This is a lucrative business for those who have no other way to get through another day on the scraps the well off leave on the sidewalk like treats to be devoured by the first thirsty one to come along. Copper has clear value and is clearly left vulnerable because no one ever imagined this shit being stripped and ripped off, so wow, there is a good example of how times have changed, the public conscience has to get over it and adapt to the new ways."

Without clear soundbites on specific positions, the press is unable to use their dismissive stock and trade, that being writing a story that’s little more than competing soundbites. Lacking a clear position from the protesters, they are unable to find someone to quote saying the exact opposite and call it journalism. So, more often than not, they’ve just ignored the whole affair.

But her technical distinctions between the court and the clerk's office (at one point Berchelmann basically calls her a liar, saying no ""reasonable person"" would say she'd close the clerk's office again under the same circumstances) probably obfuscate the legal question enough to conclude removal isn't justified, even if ""there is a valid reason why many in the legal community are not proud of Judge Keller's actions."""

234,A while ago I was looking to make a pretty large purchase. A new TV. Like a lot of consumers these days I did a LOT of research online before even going to a store. I even went to a few stores to “showroom”. This is a new-ish and growing phenomenon in the retail world (On a side note… this is what’s killing some major retailers these days). I was a “lay-down” sale. All that was needed was for the sales person to confirm my decision and then ask for my money. I went to Future Shop and gave the sales person a chance to do just this. He did a great job showing me the features of some TVs and he did a great job confirming my initial decision. And then he just stood there… it was weird and uncomfortable… it went something like this:

I'm a white girl with blue eyes and freckles. Any damage done from sun or stress to skin like mine ends up looking haggard quite quickly. Every shadow and indent on my face stands out against the background of pale Irish skin. I've worn sunblock pretty religiously since about 15 or 16, and I eat as organic and whole foods as we can on this tiny budget, but I can't erase the exhaustion and late lights/early mornings of the occasional life crisis and nursing and co-sleeping and raising four kids- I didn't nurse Ian, but raising him along with his Momma and Mr. Curry?

241,"The next step in my journey to learn about dirt was at an organic soil prep workshop. One of the first things that the Master Gardener made us understand is that grass is persistent. Unless you completely pull up ALL of the roots, you will not get rid of it and it will grow back. This is why when you compost grass, it should only be grass clippings and not roots: you don't want your compost bin or where you incorporate your compost to start sprouting grass. The areas that are going to be dug up in our yard won't be terribly deep, so we figured that unless we spend A LOT of time sifting that dirt it won't be terribly useful thanks to that persistent grass."

245,"I’ve discussed (i) before in a couple different places (here and in the comments here). It is essentially a matter of how we should understand the notion of ‘ought’ or ‘should’, whether we should a) take its use in descriptions of what ought to be as explanatorily primary, b) take its use in descriptions of what we ought to do as explanatorily primary, or c) deny that there is any sort of explanatory priority between the two. The dispute is essentially a matter of whether we should think of the principle deontic modal operator which we can apply to propositions (analogous to the alethic modal operator ‘It is necessary that…’) as principally meaning ‘It should be the case that…’ or ‘One should make it the case that…’, or whether there just are two different meanings that cannot be reduced to each other. For ease of use, I’m going to talk about this in terms of whether the deontic (or binding) should be understood principally in terms of ideal states of affairs (or just ideal states), in terms of obligations to act as more ordinarily understood, or neither. It’s important to point out that the notion of ideal state subsumes the more common notion of function, the best examples of which are technical and biological functions (e.g., ‘the heart should pump blood around the body’, and ‘the power cable should conduct electricity’, respectively)."

249,"I dealt with why this was a bad pragmatic plan last time. Let’s talk about the principled reasons why this is dumb. “Fair.” Let’s make the tax code fair. Children, whiny, spoiled children whine about “fair”—adults talk about justice. What is justice? Well the simplest definition would be that everyone gets what they deserve. So is the tax code just? Nope. There are far too many loopholes and deductions where the government quite unjustly tries to pick winners and losers, and the taxes are too high. It’s a double injustice. Now if you wanted to talk about justice instead of fairness you would get rid of the loopholes and lower the rates (although true justice would require that everyone pays at least something as everyone benefits from government protections of a military, police and court system). Raising the rate on people because they’ve done well isn’t just, it’s punishing success (but liberals don’t believe money is made through skill and drive but because of corruption in despite of all knowledge of human nature and history). But if you really wanted justice and not just a whine of fair you would support the Ryan Plan. Hell, since, as Ryan has put out numerous times, it’s up the Ways and Means Committee to decide the future of loopholes…how about eliminating all deductions after $200,000…and reduce them for income after $100,000. Republicans would support that. Because it’s just or at least more just than what we have now. But raising rates isn’t just…it’s not even fair as you’re talking about raising rates on capital gains (money that derives from income which has already been taxed, and then invested in companies which also pay corporate taxes, so yes let’s tax it a third time…and if you buy anything with it we’ll slap some sales tax on that too…oh yeah that’s fair). But please continue whining about fair."

Most of the Belgians tended to emphasize strength over sour--probably a reflection of Portlanders' tastes. On the other hand, there were hops a'poppin. Even in Belgian and German beers."

Anyway, I’m about to tell you something truly amazing. Even when the nasty Ellie comes out and I’m practically clawing and screaming at God in my head, He actually listens to me, and He even answers me! Every time I sit down and think about that it just blows me away. Here I am, being an ungrateful brat with God and He’s actually listening, comforting, and SOMETIMES He even gives me what I’m demanding of Him!"

266,"Meanwhile, I am somehow not only comfortable with all the religious symbols affixed to my car, I am getting a huge creative kick out of recombining them into an optimistic and inclusive art project. The religions theme is subtle, woven through the mosaic, alongside other motifs emerging organically (peace, the cast-off toys from our growing children, art for the sake of art). But though I did not set out with this intention, I see now that my religious interior–complex, colorful, joyous, open to interpretation, simultaneously familiar and incrutable–now has an exterior manifestation, on the hood of my car.

269,"I can’t really say I cared for any of the performances in this movie either. The first thing that started getting on my nerves was that they were supposed to be in France, and every character was supposed to be French, but all they could really muster was one word a piece in French. Once every 20 minutes or so, a character would say something like, “That is terrible!” but with terrible being pronounced as it would be in French, like teh-ree-blay. I don’t need them to speak a lot in French, but you can also not bother having them speak French at all. And you can just have the movie not be set in France because they never really left the house of the scientist anyway. Patricia Owens had to do most of the carrying of this movie, but never really seemed that up to the task. I suppose it wasn’t really her fault, but she didn’t impress. This movie made me realize that every actress had the exact same crying technique. To cry, you need only to drape yourself sideways over something like a desk or a bannister, bury your face in crook of your arm, and make weeping noises. Every girl does this exact thing when crying in these old movies. And Owens does it around three times in this movie alone. Also, as this movie is kind of a horror movie, you know that she’ll have to scream. Her scream sounded really weird, and probably a few octaves deeper than it should have. She also annoyed me when she grabbed the fly net away from her son to try to catch the fly because he had already caught half a jar full of flies and she was unable to catch one. Maybe you should leave it to the pro, honey. This is going to sound weird, but I actually liked the way David Hedison acted when he was the fly, even though he couldn’t speak or even show his face. He didn’t do anything impressive when he had his face, so they covered it up with a blanket and said that it looked like fly under there. But they worked out a method of communication for him involving typing, writing on a chalkboard, and knocking on a desk for yes and no. But his body language was well-executed so that he could still act even without the use of his face. Even Vincent Price didn’t impress me in this movie. I don’t think this is the type of movie that he really shined in. It’s kind of a horror movie, but he wasn’t trying to be spooky in it. From what I’ve gathered about him, that’s what he’s best at. In this one, he just had to be really concerned and mopey all the time, and it didn’t really work for me."

It's not without flaw or contradiction and, in many ways, it seems amoral, but it has its poignancy and true emotion as well. A great many ins and outs and subtleties play through it and it's rather fascinating to follow them around to find out yet another secret. Actually, as more is revealed, more becomes tidy and holds together with the big linchpin to the whole thing being Kaname, not the youthful Kaname Kuran everyone thinks he is but the endlessly old Kaname who was as much a factor in the decline of vampires' ascendency as he was the creation of the vampire hunters."

He rules for life until one of his sons takes over. In this way he’s like Saddam, Qaddafi, Idi Amin, the House of Saud, every petty and vengeful dictator since the dawn of time. Over an eternity, wouldn’t Odin eventually grow bored? Wouldn’t he at least experiment with sadism, hedonism, recklessness? (The myths often have him doing exactly this.) What makes him so good?"

There was an open letter on here last week to the British prime minister which was tongue-in-cheek and was intended to highlight the country’s subordination by our neighbour who is bailing us out, to highlight some very high salaries in the higher echelons of the law enforcement/judicial/legislative sectors with poor laws on the ground and an abundance of law-breaking. It was also intended to highlight commercial distortions in our economy which has yet to be allowed naturally adjust to the economic collapse. So the letter was tongue-in-cheek, but I wonder is it time for having well-placed questions asked in our neighbour’s parliament about the pigtroughery in this country which is massively insolvent and which faces a vista of a further three years of ever more constricting austerity? After all, not all British MPs were supportive of bailing out any EuroZone country."

Whilst on many occasions the copyright owner and the owner of the artwork may be the same, ownership of the physical work by no means guarantees ownership of the copyright in the work. Thus, for example, whilst a gallery may own (or have been loaned) an artwork, they may not necessarily be able to make and sell postcards, t-shirts etc of the relevant work. However, as with every rule there is at least one exception in the CDPA."

Without that extra time, the company wouldn't have been able to meet its obligations. Secondly, an accountant was brought in to compile a report of the company's finances. That report, when eventually made public, was to have an enormous impact."

BMD is a weekly event I started this semester where I bake several vegan desserts and/or breads based on a theme, and invite lots of people over to help eat them. I wanted to try to incorporate the tea into the jam for the scones I was making, so I decided to use darjeeling tea which goes well with apples, ginger and cloves. I used granny smith apples to give a little tartness, but feel free to use a another variety if you prefer. Since I couldn't find a tea jam recipe, I improvised. I used the tea bags at two separate times; I'm not sure if that is necessary but the result was delicious with the perfect amount of darjeeling flavor. Feel free to experiment!"

Studies show that only a small percent of our communication involves actual words: 7%. In fact, 55% of our communication is visual (body language and facial expressions) and 38% is vocal (pitch, speed, volume, and tone of voice).

461,"What few survivors remained after this burning war trod a world inhospitable to life. They turned inward, and dug deep into the bowels of the earth, where fires burned eternal, and here they held onto a pathetic simulacrum of their former lives, rooting out a meager existence. Bent by the weight of destruction above, bowed by the cloistering caverns of their new life, and forever peering into the dangerous darkness that bound them, the survivors struggled for many long generations before feeling the diminished caress of the faded sun on their faces. When they emerged at last into the light of day, the world was an unrecognizable, inhospitable red desert, with barely enough air to fill the lungs, and a dark red sun blazing above. It was infinitely better than the tunnels they left."

There is the literal flying fitness level - being able to do the little things effortlessly like carry your glider to launch or back to your car and running off launch without pulling a muscle (hey - I've seen it happen!). Personally I'm failing at this right now...my back started protesting Thursday morning from abusing it too much. Like getting dehydrated (my chiropractor said this also depletes the fluid in your spinal column which leaves you prone to back injuries...makes sense), and then throwing my tandem gear around without using the proper ""bend your knees and lift"" technique. I also went on a hike and fly with some friends...they hiked all the way up and I joined them until the halfway point since I volunteered to be the driver this time. It's sad to think that fun little hike could be the reason my back went out, but a good reminder to take care of yourself every day so you can prevent stuff like this happening."

In this show, if the participants give a wrong answer to the question, one of their small dolls on their table, which briefly stands for their score, fall inside the chute and deprived by the host, then the host says Bo Chute! each time it happens.

From the patronising tradition of the modernisation paradigm, more emphasis is seemingly now on dialogue and empowerment, involving beneficiaries in the communication process and giving them power to shape policies (Quebral 1972). DSC itself came about as a solution to the limitations of Development Communication (DC) where communication barriers emanating from cultural, wealth and power differences between the development agents (benefactor) and the targeted communities (beneficiaries) were not fully questioned. A redirection of development initiatives towards participation of the intended beneficiaries in planning and implementation of development programmes resulted (Agunga 2006)."

501,"When I met my first husband and settled into adult life (ADULT!?! I was such a baby, but that's another story), I felt pretty happy and I wanted to write about it. I would sit down with a journal, but nothing would come. The only time the words would ever flow freely from my pen was when I was feeling somber or troubled. This held true as the years flowed by, and if I pick up my journals now and look back, it is very rare to find an entry that is not tinged by at least a little bit of sadness or discontent. I suppose that is somewhat telling of how my story has played out, but I swear that there really were some happy times. There had to have been.

554,"And then out of the dark came my father’s precious, long-fingered hand and found mine. Tenderly, reassuringly, his clasp tightened. It let up a bit, tightened again, this time hard. He didn’t say a word, didn’t even look at me. But comfort, understanding, and reassurance flowed from his hand to my heart, and I was healed."
555,"The Old Program allows for a Money System (Capitalism) where “Slavery” is allowed to exist. Where its apparently “Ok” for one with all the money to enslave others to doing slave labour. And that this is apparently “just how the system works” all the while we are missing the point that this is NOT “Just how the system works” but that this is How we have Created the System to work and thus we require to correct it. To Create a New System with Rules that Support and provide for all equally. Thus a World System, an Education System, A Monetary System, a housing system, a transportation system based on The Principle of Equality – and Thus this is what an Equal Money System is."

557,"Because children, however, especially black and brown poor children, are plagued by circumstances beyond their control, Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children’s Defense Fund, began the Freedom Schools movement. It is, simply, an amazing program, which takes children at risk and makes them know that they can do anything they want – beginning with reading – and moving on. The program is run by the national CDF staff, but the classes in these schools are taught by college-aged kids many of whom learn, quite by accident, that they have a passion for reaching kids whom society has all but thrown away."
558,"So here's my ""sterling plan""...I will check ebay and poke around locally to see the best chances to add to my sterling pattern. I'm hoping I will find some pieces here because the original Oneida factory is about twenty miles from where I live and am hoping that there will be pieces from years ago for sale around here!! Oneida has closed and everything is being made in China, I think...and I don't think that they even do any sterling anymore. They used to have a factory store that sold all sorts of things from the factory and I remember seeing seconds of this pattern there. But those days are gone :-("

560,"By basing his story in Varanasi, Chetan has shown the willingness to go beyond the metros he has generally portrayed in his story and probably strike a cord with the semi urban populace. His descriptions of each and every ghat are fantastic which goes to show the amount of research he has put in for the same. Another interesting fact different from his earlier books is that the main protagonist is shown (at least in the first half) as someone who isn’t rich but generally has to save money to make do with things in his life."
561,"But, I'm here now, and I have some really fun stuff to share with you that I've listed on Etsy recently... My favorites are the great 1960s pin-up girls I scored - I've never seen any quite like them before! All of them are covered with a plastic sheet that says Lift Here in the bottom right hand corner. The girls' clothes and other accessories are printed on the plastic. When you lift up the plastic, the girls are nude underneath - clever!"

Another way of avoiding the stress was by kicking that deadline to the wayside & making my own. 2.5 months is good enough for me."

572,"Atemi are feints or strikes that are used as attacks against the vital points o the body. This movement is meant to cause much damage; so it is rarely being used in aikido. Still, if there is a need, one can use atemi in fighting your way out of brawls. It can also be used as a form of distraction. Atemis can take your opponent by surprise and break his concentration by providing a startling incident. When used the right way, it can also ruin your opponent’s balance, which can provide an opportunity for you to strike or to run away."
573,"“The Tuareg rebellion was only a sign of the depths to which Mali has fallen,” Konaté concludes. “The state of the Malian army is just that of Malian society. Consensus, which had been an asset in Mali — where ethnic groups got along fraternally — became a liability once it was hijacked by the politicians.”"

Images of superhero characters have been emblazoned across a dizzying array of licensed merchandise for decades, while popular culture abounds with references to superheroes and their characteristic traits, a sure sign that they have entered the lexicon of everyday life."

580,"Even more distracting is the parade of 80-something bare-naked bodies in the locker room. I bet I have a different view of the flesh I’m living in by the time I get to be nearly-dead too. I mean, then I’ll be anticipating leaving it soon enough and I’ll be proud of the fact I can get my clothes off and my swimsuit on eventually. There will be no hurry. I won’t care if ten forty-something chickens stand gawking while they try to cover their transfer from dressed to swim-ready. I’ll either be truly comfortable in my own skin or so detached from it I won’t even feel naked. If my mind is sharp enough, I’ll probably think of this blog post and laugh at myself."
581,"In the next four to six weeks, you'll be absorbed with one of your favourite things -- money! Suddenly, your focus on cash flow is heightened. The reason you're focusing on your cash flow is it is flowing more! This means either you are getting a boost in your earnings (fingers crossed), or you're spending a lot. (I suspect the latter.) Fortunately, you're no spend thrift, even though you love gorgeous things. But you do work very hard to make your home as beautiful as it can possibly be. (Right there, I see money flying out the window, don't you?) Relax. Enjoy yourself. Don't worry about avoiding temptation -- as you get older, it starts avoiding you!"

589,"On the evening of the first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 'Peace be with you!' After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. Again Jesus said, 'Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.' And with that he breathed on them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.'"

I want to continue it, since I do think it's valuable for the students and families who participate, but I wish I could figure out a way to get more involvement. I'd love to individualize it more to each student's needs and goals, but that's kind of not worth it to me with such low participation. I don't know...I'd love to hear ideas, especially from teachers who can't require homework and/or who have lower-functioning students."

602,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to review the literature regarding Withania somnifera (ashwagandha, WS) a commonly used herb in Ayurvedic medicine. Specifically, the literature was reviewed for articles pertaining to chemical properties, therapeutic benefits, and toxicity. DESIGN: This review is in a narrative format and consists of all publications relevant to ashwagandha that were identified by the authors through a systematic search of major computerized medical databases; no statistical pooling of results or evaluation of the quality of the studies was performed due to the widely different methods employed by each study. RESULTS: Studies indicate ashwagandha possesses anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antistress, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, hemopoietic, and rejuvenating properties. It also appears to exert a positive influence on the endocrine, cardiopulmonary, and central nervous systems. The mechanisms of action for these properties are not fully understood. Toxicity studies reveal that ashwagandha appears to be a safe compound. CONCLUSION: Preliminary studies have found various constituents of ashwagandha exhibit a variety of therapeutic effects with little or no associated toxicity. These results are very encouraging and indicate this herb should be studied more extensively to confirm these results and reveal other potential therapeutic effects. Clinical trials using ashwagandha for a variety of conditions should also be conducted."
603,"Why am I telling you all of this? I want to tell you a story about my friend Patricia and how someone made the effort to know her. I met Patricia 3 years ago my first time around at Starbucks. She had just transferred from California and had very little. From day one, I knew we would be good friends. I soon found out that Patricia was a new believer and really desired to grow though it was hard in this new environment where she knew no one. I did what I could to get her involved and to minister to her before I left for Ecuador. Just yesterday, Patricia and I went out to lunch to catch up. I found out she was going to Bent Tree Bible Church and loving it. As I inquired as to how she started going there, she told me about one of her customers. The customer had taken the time to get to know Patricia as she came in every day. The week before Easter, she invited Patricia to go to Bent Tree with her. From the very first time she walked through those doors, she felt at home and so did her 5 year old daughter. Now it is her church home, she goes every Sunday, her daughters are involved in the children's ministry and Patricia helps out. Not only that, but she is meeting with a group of women who also work at Starbucks to have a weekly Bible study. I don't know who that customer was who began to minister to Patricia, but God used that to advance his kingdom."

616,"My weekend was a write-off, chores-wise, although a big success in other ways. I did my belt grading at Karate on Saturday morning, and now have a shiny new Blue Belt. Woohoo! But a grading is a pretty gruelling process, what with it being a solid 3 hours of fairly full-on sweat-fest. Saturday afternoon was spent celebrating, and by Saturday evening I was only good for lying down and moving as little as possible. On Sunday I felt like I had been hit by a truck, so housework really didn’t figure on the radar."
617,"What helps is that Flanagan frames this novel as Flynn writing his memoirs instead of simply following Flynn through the years. Flynn has a very distinctive voice; practical, wry, but with a heaping handful of melancholy. When Flynn first introduces us to his parents, he suddenly reflects on the fact that, although they’re dead now, he can still hear their voices clearly. This makes Evening’s Empire a sad, although certainly not a dark, novel. All of the Ravons are quite distinct; glamorous rock star Emerson, pretentious artist Simon, and cheerful, mischievous Charlie, who comes into the forefront towards the end of the novel, when Flynn and his family help him through chemotherapy. Danny Finnerty, who isn’t considered a real Ravon because he’s an American replacement, doesn’t figure as much, but, just when I was nervous that Flanagan was ripping on rap for no apparent reason, he unleashes a brilliant defense of the genre that went immediately into my commonplace book. Evening’s Empire is a longish novel—a little over 600 pages—but these characters carry it along throughout the years, as any good family epic should. (Although the short, thriller-esque chapters certainly help.)"

645,"Occasionally parents respond with shock or dismay upon finding out their son or daughter has gender identity issues or crossdresses. While some parents may have suspected or denied it, many never imagined such a possibility. This is particularly true in situations where the grown children adopted stereotyped roles and socially-acceptable gender behaviors in order to mask their gender identity issues or crossdressing needs. While it may be difficult to accept that your child has these issues, and it may not initially be possible to offer validation or acceptance, please remember that your child needs your love and compassion. Do not reject your son or daughter because this may result in unresolvable differences."

657,"At this point Dr. John Reynolds, the President of Corpus Christi College of Oxford, a leader of the Puritan side in the Church of England, and one of the greatest scholars of his day, proposed a new translation of the Bible into English. King James responded warmly to this suggestion because he despised the then popular Geneva Bible. The king was troubled by the often revolutionary margin notes of the Geneva Bible which spoke extensively against corrupt and immoral kings. King James ordered that a single translation that the whole nation could rely on ""to be read in the whole church"", should be produced by 50 of the nations finest language scholars and he approved rules for carefully checking the results, including no marginal notes at all to be effected, but only for the explanation of the Hebrew or Greek words, and to draw attention to parallel passages."

He told us not to worry too much, but 6 months later when it was checked again, we were devastated to learn that I had papillary carcinoma, a form of thyroid cancer. Even the word “cancer” struck fear in our hearts, and I didn’t want to go through what I had seen my husband endure.

It’s based on the supposition that the domestic 1% is guilty of something or other the domestic 10 or 30 or 50% isn’t, and therefore deserves to be a target of scorn in a way the 10 or 30 or 50% does not.

724,"During the early years of the Troubles, army attempts to gather intelligence in republican areas were a fairly hit and miss affair. The need to put matters on a more rigorous footing led to the creation of an undercover army company trained specifically for the task of putting under surveillance republican paramilitary members in nationalist areas of NI where uniformed soldiers and policemen could not operate. This company, 14 Intelligence Company (also known, and subsequently referred to here, as the Det) was to prove its effectiveness time and time again. However, there will be no equivalent in our Muslim Troubles, a point the explication of which will shed some light on the nature of the conflict that awaits us."

733,"On the boat, the crew said they had lost not only all their possessions but their jobs. Cosmo promised to give them £5 towards restitution – an offer that was deliberately misinterpreted by one of the crew later as a bribe not to return for survivors because the Duff Gordons were allegedly afraid their small rowing boat would be swamped. In a stoical and moving account of the tragedy sent from New York to his anxious siblings, Cosmo writes: “Indeed at that moment I would have given anything that I possessed to anybody who wanted it, as my heart was full of thanksgiving that the two women in my charge and myself were where we were.”"

To be able to show off with our gaming provess since we have no hot women to show off or money."
739,"When I read Hofmeyr’s account I was delighted, as it appeared to support an idea that I had developed independently. Drawing on my insights as a teacher of the Alexander Technique (AT), I devised a series of movements that combines dynamically the knee–chest position with kneeling on all fours. Over several years I have taught this technique at my special AT and movement classes for pregnant women, and my experience suggests that it is effective. Of course, in the absence of a scientific statistical study it cannot be ruled out that the cases where it seems to have worked were just a series of lucky turns. Proper research will be required in order to reach firmer conclusions. Be that as it may, most childbirth educators will agree that these movements have several beneficial effects during pregnancy and in childbirth, irrespective of the baby’s position."
740,"notes, is all about being “committed to making the sort of high-quality, high-performance, innovative products for which the world will pay extra.” The choice is ours — and it starts with the beer in your fridge. I have only one problem here: the analogy is flawed. Even at ten bones a sixer, beer remains a huge value when compared with good liquor or wine. It's true that Grain Belt is cheaper, but the distance between Bud and Sierra Nevada is pretty slight in absolute terms. The analogy may point to something real in the economy--though David's evidence is actually pretty thin--but I would hate to have it rise and fall on the example of craft beer. It's still a pretty cheap thrill."

748,"McBride was convicted of the Magoo’s bar bombing, and sentenced to death. However, lady luck was on his side as the South African government had declared a moratorium on capital punishment in 1990. Then suddenly another man, on the other end of the political spectrum, appeared on the scene -- namely, Barend Strydom (aka Wit Wolf) who was convicted of eight counts of murder, and who was also sentenced to death. Both men, together with 150 other political prisoners, were eventually released from jail after a deal between FW de Klerk’s National Party government and the ANC in 1992. The TRC subsequently granted both men amnesty for their crimes. --- See also: McBride’s Irish-Boer Connection below."

758,"NFC is quickly becoming a regular feature in today’s smartphones. RIM was not the first to implement NFC in their devices, but they’re definitely making it a standard in its future ones. Incorporating RIM’s security and acquisitions they’ve made, we could see RIM being a leader in the NFC field when it comes to payments, electronic entry to buildings, etc etc. Even through its new peripheral device – the BlackBerry Music Gateway announced at BB World 2012, RIM is showing that they are serious about the potential of NFC when it comes to sharing content, pairing devices and much much more."

772,"Finally, we all know what’s happened at the top. Chelsea’s takeover was a monumental event. Practically on the eve of our move to the Emirates it forced us to rethink our plans. In that instant we were priced out of the best players, but Abramovich was also one of the catalysts for the subsequent spiralling wages, as the rest of the league was impelled to offer their players more competitive salaries and bonuses. The average Premier League wage bill has more than doubled in the last eight years – and I doubt we saw that coming in 2003."

Don't peak for at least an hour unless either of the following happens: the smoke escaping from the grill is thick and white instead of thin and blue, OR there is no smoke coming out of the grill (assuming you're trying to get some smoke flavor in there). If there's too much smoke, it's not going to taste right, and it's indicative of the wood chunk igniting instead of smoldering. If that's the case, move it away from the coals, spritz a little water on it, and soak it better next time. If there's no smoke, you might have to add another wood chunk because your first one burnt out, or maybe it was too wet or had insufficient contact with the coals to start smoldering."

Then I like this book for how angry and passionate it makes me and the discussions in class amuse me. Sometimes, I like this book for how it removes the Oriental exoticism from India. At other times, I like this book because I like reading about places that are not London or New York."

The shade was just a bit light on me, but blended in nicely anyway. It did last for the most of the day, but felt a bit greasy and oily towards the end of the day as with a few other foundations i've tried, and just needed to touch up with MAC's Careblend Pressed Powder.

806,"Distillation can be done quite simply. It just needs a well constructed collection system or you will lose A LOT of water as steam escapes the distillation device. It also takes a lot of energy to distill water. It requires bringing water to a boil and keeping it there until you have collected enough distilled water. Distillation is the most expensive way to treat drinking water, due to the energy cost. This is why many coastal cities do not get their drinking water from the ocean. It only makes financial sense when the price of water can offset the cost of energy. There are solar distillation devices that are available and are a good option if you are in a hot sunny region. Solar distillation devices work better when they are small, however smaller devices produce less water."

Our Special Forces remain our primary combat advisor force. But unless we decide to increase the number of SF Groups and expand SF capacity, we will need more conventional types (GPF) to execute the advisory missions that the NDS addresses. We currently have GPF advisors in a variety of areas like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Columbia. The Army is standing up regionally aligned brigades (RAB) for advisory and theater-cooperation missions in Africa beginning in 2013. The advisory mission is a less-expensive yet effective way of maintaining our presence in areas of interest around the globe. We ought to consider such duty as important as developmental positions (perhaps as important as key/ command billets) given that such duty affords one the opportunity to shape foreign military leaders and potential future national-level leaders (as a result of his previous advisor assignment, current JCS Chairman and former Program Manager for the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) modernization program, GEN Dempsey, maintains good relations with King Abdullah, the current king of Saudi Arabia and former commander of SANG)."

Even without Obama's endorsement, white women must know the truth, particularly those who live in the inner cities, where the evidence is all around them."
832,"Perhaps I was naive (read: a little dumb) and everyone else knew it but me, but neither of these things are true. You don’t have to like other babies or other kids because they’re not yours. You’ll love yours like mad. And you don’t have to know much about babies or kids because you’re not directly responsible for the upbringing and general maintenance of other babies or other kids."

834,"That is where legacy comes in. Most politicians would shirk from such issues because they have deep political consequences. In violent countries like Pakistan, they have human consequences as well. So for those for whom the present trumps the future, it makes sense to acquiesce to the crowd. Many would even climb on their backs, against their principals, as we've seen happen recently. But where does that leave them when it is all said and done, and the historian picks up the pen to define them?"

The US attorney-general, Eric Holder, defends the “right” of his government to assassinate American citizens. Israel, the protege, is allowed to aim its nukes at nukeless Iran. In this looking glass world, the lying is panoramic. The massacre of 17 Afghan civilians on 11 March, including at least nine children and four women, is attributed to a “rogue” American soldier. The “authenticity” of this is vouched by President Obama himself, who had “seen a video” and regards it as “conclusive proof”. An independent Afghan parliamentary investigation produces eyewitnesses who give detailed evidence of as many as 20 soldiers, aided by a helicopter, ravaging their villages, killing and raping: a standard, if marginally more murderous US special forces “night raid”."

866,"The only true Joy we can have in this world and even in Heaven is receiving Jesus Christ inside our heart. Even if we have receive Jesus Christ in our hearts, God wants us to set us free from all pains, fear, sorrows, worries or condemnations we might still put aside. Jesus Christ wants us to live Heaven here on earth, which is full of Love, Joy, Peace, and Righteousness. We are made Holy and Righteous by the Blood of Jesus Christ, and we continue to live a Righteous life because of what He has done for us on the Cross, that He died for us while we were still sinners."

It was a gift, indeed, to live among the friends he served and to be entrusted with getting their families where they needed to go–and today, it seemed every man, woman, and child for miles around was showing up to wish him and Zanna well.

It was a bit of a walk, maybe 25 minutes or so but we arrived in plenty of time to go through at a leisurely pace, behind a big school group and with LOTS of other tourists. Still very nice.

880,"By the time Rancid finished, it was getting pretty dark, it had stopped raining for the most part (yay!), and you could feel the crowd energy rising. The crowd was definitely made up mostly of Rise Against fans! We stood around waiting, feeling the occasional cool rain drops on our face, breathing in the tons of secondhand marijuana smoke (there were seriously TONS of people smoking weed! I was amazed at the joint to cigarette ratio, since there really weren't many people smoking cigarettes at all. We were even offered some for free, though we turned it down of course. ;-) (Seriously, we did turn it down. Unknown dealer=bad idea!)), hearing the intermittent chants of ""Rise Against!"", and waiting with excitement. We worked our way right up into the front of the crowd, where we'd have a good view. When they finally came on, the crowd went wild! I was very happy to have the earplugs that we'd brought (always a good idea to have at concerts!). We had a great time, jumping up and down, singing along loudly, and getting bumped into nearly constantly by people. I've never really been in ""the pit"" at a concert before, and it can get pretty rough. You have to be aware of the people around you, keep your arms up to easily protect your head and upper torso, and not mind being squashed against multiple people! Except for one jerk who literally smashed into people with no care for injury, everyone was really cool though. The worst injuries I got were frequently squished toes and a fairly light elbow to the throat (and in the latter case, I instantly had a complete strangers hand on my shoulder and a concerned query if I was alright. As I said, most people were really cool. :-)). It also helped that there was very little real moshing, and when there was we were careful to stay out of it! At the closest, there was only one person between us and the barrier in front of the stage. It was really cool to have the lead singer actually that close, and singing straight to those of us right in front! :-D We ended up moving to a safer location later on in the show, when the aforementioned jerk moved into our area, but it was still a good spot."
881,"Specifically, I started this blog on March 27th, eight days after Konrath and Eisler published the first of their dialogues about self-publishing (which I think at some point got christened 'Be The Monkey', but I haven't looked into that too hard, out of fear).

A very good looking man, who owned and ran several pubs (always went bankrupt in the end) and after he had squandered his wife´s dowry he embarked on a boat to Buenos Aires, with high hopes, it seems, only to return to Europe as penniless as he had left.

I was impressed with the amount of water that it got off of my lettuce (click the picture above for a larger view) The lettuce stated fresh and crisp in the storage container for at least 48 hours (that is when I used the rest of what I had rinsed). The convenience of having fresh rinsed berries and lettuce help make it easier to make better eating choices by having the preparation already done."
913,"But is when COP Leader Prakash Ramadhar started to zest up he self and talk about poaching, and wanting back the mayorship whose “allocation” was given to him that I start to pause and check out the thing. It seems that Local Govt Politics has its own morality as well. at first I didn’t understand why Ramadhar felt it was his right to choose the mayor until I realised that in local government elections it’s the party with the most seats that consults with the councillors and other pertinent bodies to select a mayor. And since is a coalition government we have, and not a coalition party, the Fyzabad Accord (which beginning to sound like a kaiso) apparently delineated which parties within the coalition would get to determine which mayorships went to whom. So the COP got Arima and San Fernando as part of their historic 2010 scramble for Trinidad and Tobago. What startled me was that these arrangements were ironed out since May 2010, and Local Government Elections happened in July of 2010…so these parties were very confident of victory."

917,"“Reading both old and modern herbals as well as more recent books on wild food, it is fairly common to come across various plants referred to as spring tonics and blood purifiers – nettles, cleavers, watercress and chickweed are good examples. As a teenager, these vague terms used to drive me mad (before ultimately driving me wild!), unable as I was to see their relevance in a world where, as far as food supply was concerned, there appeared to be no seasons at all or, rather, there seemed to prevail one ceaseless monolithic season of eternal plenty, one long continuous produce perfecting summer. Unquestioningly taking this to be the natural and best state of affairs, the very idea that local, seasonal plants – let alone wild plants – could act as nutritional restoratives relative to a period of depletion and deprivation seemed anathema, even in some way insulting, having no resonance or relevance with regard to my health, eating habits or prior experience and lifestyle. In fact, I had become spoilt, blind, lazy, stupefied and unaware, living in a bubble unchallenged and unresponsive to nature’s dynamic seasons with their inherent change, challenge and delightful unpredictability. Ironically, it is now this very awareness of ceaseless change, transition and unpredictability, of responding to the creative challenges thrown up throughout the wild food year that so stimulates and excites me, that ultimately helps me to feel fully energised and alive. Wild foods in their abundant seasonal variety now serve as hard won year-long counter-tonics to the former dumbed down and beguiling supermarket crap that I used to consume.”"

If the gasoline-air mixture is too lean, the flame will not have enough speed to get across the cylinder in the time permitted by the engine RPM the driver wants, or the flame will not even start – the cylinder misfires, and then the catalyst has to oxidize a huge amount of UHC and thus may overheat (which might mean you have to buy a new catalyst)."

It's a potent blend, and the album's six epic compositions churn with noisy waves of distortion weaving between the pounding techno beats, with bits and pieces of electronic detritus flying around the edges. On the closer, ""Face the Music,"" the techno reference point is hidden, nearly erased by the volatile onslaught of digital noise; it feels, rather than sounds, like there's an actual techno track hidden somewhere in the mix, a ghostly subliminal presence that exists only as the faintest forward pulse hidden at the core of the dense sound. The opening track, ""Misery Beat,"" is more direct in its rhythmic drive, and in between these two extremes Swanson explores various intersections between dance music, abstraction and noisy catharsis.

960,"Dad went through the garage but rather than follow suit, I waited for him to unlock the front door. Call it silly or superstitious, but I wanted to start this off on the right foot, and I certainly wasn’t going to access my new home through an out-of-the-way side entrance. I stepped up into the house and felt awe. The windows were beautiful, the ceiling twenty feet high, the sunlight filtered in just the right amount to gorgeously illuminate the interior."

962,"Heat mats come in various sizes, but I selected one that fit the space I intended to place it on which holds about 4 seed starting trays at a time. Think a bit beyond your immediate needs. If you think it's possible you might expand your garden, don't buy the smallest mat! On the other hand, if you buy something too large, it might not fit on your table or you could have some seeds on the mat but not under your grow lights. The mat and the grow lights should match in size."

967,"This new moving pictures craze was sweeping the United States -- two million patrons in 1907, according to the Saturday Evening Post -- and like everything foreign and new, it was soon seen as a corrupting influence, 'demoralising' children, a bastard offspring of vaudeville and burlesque."

975,"Had the authors of PPACA set up an “uninsured patient tax”, with anyone who buys qualifying insurance exempted from said tax, the lawsuit against PPACA would be dead in its tracks. Now, there might be states rights claims against the Medicaid expansion, and I suppose one could argue that the state exchanges infringe on states rights, as well. But those seem like huge leaps."
976,"“We synthesized the results of neuroimaging studies using visual stimuli from across the world. The results are strong enough to remain true despite the variability between the research designs, samples and tasks, making the perceptual account of autistic cognition currently the most validated model. The stronger engagement of the visual system, whatever the task, represents the first physiological confirmation that enhanced perceptual processing is a core feature of neural organization in this population. We now have a very strong statement about autism functioning which may be ground for cognitive accounts of autistic perception, learning, memory and reasoning.”"
977,"Nomads by Nature is hosting this week's Round Up on the very timely theme of Independence Day, which is, of course, the holiday in the middle of next week! And while many of my friends at Embassies and Consulates around the world are frantically preparing for their official celebrations in honor of America's National Day, I am preparing for a relaxing week. Because we celebrated our National Day in March, to avoid the heat and summer slowdown. And right now, I am very thankful for that.

He’s also released a letter to the media. I doubt any of it will make a difference.

989,"So yeah, I guess some gnomes were here."
990,"Grayson nodded, but he wasn’t really listening. I knew I should have killed the bastard myself. It was obvious that somehow she’d gone south after Valderas had contacted her through the priest."
991,"He killed me once again. One hundred and fifty thousand deaths later, two decades of running down that same path, and we’re still no closer to getting that “princess in another castle” than we were at that birthday party in 1988. It was cute at first. He was learning the controls, seeing how I could jump, run and grow. I wish I could’ve shed a tear when he learned how to shoot fire from my hands. Those were good days."
992,"We are still here in the Rocky Mountains in Great Falls, Montana. We’re glad to be back in the mountains again. We love it here. We love the change of the season’s and the beautiful winter snow! However… the –degree temperatures are REALLY cold!! The wind chill got down to -25! This past year we really have enjoyed going down by the Missouri River. It is gorgeous. We are enjoying the outdoors more and more. We were able to take a little first family trip to Glacier Park this summer and it was absolutely beautiful. We stayed in a little secluded cabin. They had 2 dogs there that the girls had fun playing catch with. The girls thought it was really cool that we were sleeping in the mountains until nighttime came; the cabin had 2 levels and the girls were too scared to sleep upstairs since they could hear the bugs outside.  So, we made them a little bed on the futon in the living room. We got to the park at the perfect time of year. The Road to the Sun had just opened and the snow was melting so there were waterfalls everywhere! We added a dog to our household this year too. She is an Irish setter and her name is Ginger. She likes to steal food from the kids and give them big kisses! We will be glad when she gets out of the puppy stage but we love having her as part of the family!"

The four of us were rolling on the floor laughing at some of the questions and things you have to do--totally worth the $25!! OMGoodness I haven't laughed that hard in a bit and after putting in major hours in projects, it was a nice stress reliever!"
995,"- For congested babies, run the hottest shower you can, aim it low so there's a place for you and your baby to sit out of the direct water line, and close the shower curtain around the shower to contain the steam. Sit in the tub with the baby (or sit them in their baby tub) to help clear their sinuses."
996,I also worked a lot of overtime this week. Any extra money from my paycheck I want to apply to my school loans. I'm sick of them! It's going on seven years now and I'm ready for it to be done so I can start putting that money to better use.

1001,"I felt a great sense of accomplishment, making all those times I forced myself to make a gym appearance worth it. I won't lie. Some days I didn't want to go. And some days I didn't (even though I felt super guilty). But the aches, hours of cardio and pushing myself to the limit culminated in crossing the finish line at the Dirty 6 Mud Run."
1002,"The Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. John W. Snow, has a letter to the dissembling editor of The Old Grey Doxy. In his epistle, which appears here through Editor and Publisher Mr. Snow makes it plain that the administration’s efforts were anything but “half-hearted” as the paper – in its paper-thin and seditious defense – claimed:"

Midas Earthcote constantly upgrades its paint recipes in pace with tinting technologies to ensure that their systems offer world-leading coating solutions."
1005,"These guys are just plain pissed off with women because they’re branded losers by girls. They have no damn self confidence when it comes to matters of women, and they, quite frankly, don’t care. You see these guys plaguing cafes, clubs and shopping malls. They hang out, almost always with friends (for confidence and support), and stare at girls."
1006,The base had been nearly cleaned out in the time since Kenneth regained consciousness. Most of the more sensitive materials had been taken and destroyed–as record-keeping had become a dangerous liability in this day and age–while others had been sealed and buried in one of the giant foxholes dug out decades ago and pre-marked by human eyes but remained inconspicuous to the Neos.
1007,It has since been said that this dear old friend of mine has caused others to develop the lesser known illness of notebook phobia (or notibookinus as it is more commonly referred to). It is an unusual phobia where the sufferer can no longer enter stationery stores and is forced to cross the road rather than walk past a cousin of my little friend. This was not my plight. In fact I strongly suspect that without my friend by my side it would not have been possible for us to achieve together all that we did.

1013,"I don’t know the context in which the music is used… I never finished watching season one and I may have seen the relevant episode already, but I can’t remember. It was about seven years ago now when it first aired. That being said, I like to imagine Commander Adama is giving his son Apollo a gift – a good lighter."

1016,"“I wasn’t alone.” Naida was looking up and smiling, it was the first sign of warmth he had seen on her face. Real warmth, Derrek knew instantly, even with such a short sentence, it was someone that meant the world to her. There was also a trace of sadness on her face, whoever it was gone, or worse. “I probably wouldn’t have been able to sleep if I was.”"
1017,"I know John and Anna in the community of dancers who meet every Sunday morning, Monday night, Wednesday night, Friday night. Week after week. Month after month. Year after year… for closing in on two decades now. I see John here right next to me; leaning slightly against me. Wiggling. Jumping up and down. Dancing in quirky ways. Music loud. People moving in ways that’d get them arrested in any supermarket checkout line. Such great joy… shared with each other. And more…somehow, magically, dancing is an antidote to suffering. The energy of dancing together; that joy. Transcendent. Those who dance together are close knit family."
1018,"Before I delve into the subject at hand, I want to shed some light onto the mindset of 19th century Victorian England, where ideas and concerns mirrored what we will see in our mid 20th century. The Victorian periodical publishing aspect I speak of is not comic books, but the entire parallel genre of children's literature which came of age in the Victorian era and where the preoccupation with childhood manifested itself in the books and magazines produced for the young. As more and more children of the middle class joined the upper class in reading, prominent literary critics of the time played leading roles as arbiters of taste and morality, especially against what was deemed the lowest rung of printed reading matter, the penny dreadfuls, the reading entity of the working class."

1031,"Well, I had intended to enter several challenges this week. It started with Emma's Throwback Thursday, always one of my favorites, in which the challenge was to use a heart from any older cartridge. So the wheels started turning. Then I saw that 365 Cards was having a ""Romance"" themed challenge. Hmmmmmmmm..... And then I saw that the Crafty Ho's were having a monochromatic color challenge. The Cuttlebug Spot was having a book inspiration challenge, and Stuck On You Sketches was having a sketch challenge. My mind was spinning, and I had what I thought was a great idea--which I didn't get finished for the Cuttlebug Spot challenge, but I did enter it into the others. I really liked the difficulty of making one project work for many challenges. This did not completely meet my expectations, but it does express the sentiment I wanted it to."

1039,"OK... so I really wanted to document this whole process with photos, but there were a couple factors involved in my failure to do that. 1) I was a nervous WRECK because I was, with the help of some friends and the cooperation of the entire cross-country/distance track team, planning and trying desperately to pull off a surprise party for Anders, so I was really busy, and 2) I'm out of practice so I just... forgot. See, I finally found this amazing recipe for a classic vanilla, yellow cake, which I used, and I wanted so badly to share it with everyone. And I will! My birthday is two weeks from tomorrow, and I'm planning on making cupcakes with this recipe for my classes (because I'm 22 going on 7 apparently), so I will post it then! I promise!"

It still feels weird to know that the business degree I’ve been working for four years is finally mine. So now I’m in the process of looking for a new job. Secondly, I finally began moving in with my boyfriend of four years, and that’s a bit nerve-wrecking. As for reading books, the last week of April gave me an opportunity to relax and enjoy a few stories. As you will see, I have not finished much, but I have successfully began several hefty novels. I am happy with the progress I’ve made so far and the quality of books I’ve picked to read. The Fellowship of the Ring is surprisingly easy to read, considering all my fears about Tolkien and his writing. I am loving A Clash of Kings even though this season took a few liberties concerning the plot. Master and Margarita is my first Russian novel in a long time, and I have to say it’s surprisingly refreshing. I had to postpone my Virginia Woolf experience for later, as I find that I am just not in the mood for it. I should be returning to it a bit later."

1048,"You know how they say that it’s not the journey, but the destination? Success is awesome, but it’s not the end-all, be-all. It’s not just about hitting a target – it’s also what you do after you’ve reached your initial goals. Are you just going to take it easy and switch off your “motivation switch”? Or are you going to make new goals and challenge yourself? These choices represent your desire to grow as a person. Sure, you don’t always have to move on to a new project right away, but it is important to ask yourself “How can I do things better?” Here’s the thing: people change, whether you like it or not. Think about it – are you the same person that you were 10 years ago? We’re never static and always remain in motion. Even after you’ve earned your first million, you’re either moving forward or backward. Although you should never take your current success for granted, you do need to understand that everything you do in the present will either help you evolve or decline. Besides, you’re not the only one – the rest of the world is also in a state of constant change. This means you need to avoid being complacent to stay on top of your game and adapt to ever-shifting circumstances. In many ways, long-term success is not just about adding another trophy to your collection. In the greater scheme of things, it boils down to maintaining the same attitude and mindset that made you successful in the first place. The way to do this is to stay sharp, stay hungry!"
1049,"Honestly, I should have seen it coming. My 39th birthday was looming on the horizon, and I’ve never been good at letting go. ‘Things’ are tagged for trash without a second thought. But I have an unnatural tendency to cling to time, significant eras and the select group of people who’ve managed, over the years, to get under my skin. Ask my sister. She’s so used to rehashing the same three topics, it’s a wonder she hasn’t sawed off her ears with the ragged-cut lid of a Campbell’s soup can. Bless her…she endures a lot in the name of friendship."

We passed our first of many frozen waterfalls we would see that day, they amazed me! And then we pulled up to this:"

I've never tried any other shipping service yet so I can't really tell the difference. I live in Canada and their shipping fee is almost always around $30. I've paid the JSK about $88, which is so cheap compared to the original, but they do warn us that the quality might not be very great."

1087,"Or can it be that, now that we have forgotten the danger of the terrible roaring lion, that we now see this returned love thing as a duty? We set aside times of the day to talk to Him, and we ceremoniously thank Him for our blessings, mainly our food, and even then, deep down, we really don’t feel like he had anything to do with it. We always have to think about giving our time and resources to His work, but we’re willing enough to claim any blessings he may send our way, and never even think about our benefactor’s warning to those who “strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel” (Matthew 23:24). I tremble to think what we would do if our lives were demanded of us in His name."

1093,"I’m spinning so fast into the world of adulthood, but I haven’t even experienced becoming a girl yet."
1094,"It’s the same with languages. The language in which you express yourself makes you express yourself in its special ways. Languages have flavours, local flavours, that make them unique experiences when you use them. I’m not saying that translations aren’t possible: sometimes they even manage to improve on the original. What I’m saying is that original and translation are not the same thing. I can try to explain what I mean with a couple of examples. Compare this translated version with its original."

1096,"On Friday I went to the National Engineering and Construction recruitment fair in Birminham to see what opportunities there might be for Queen Mary Students and Graduates. The results were surprisingly upbeat. After quite a difficult recruitment year in 2009, things are starting to look up for this sector."
1097,"These old photos - the headers and a few family pictures - are from the farm in Vermont that we left in 1971. This photo is from the last Christmas on the place - after breakfast we looked into our Christmas stockings. Yes, even as adults everyone got a stocking full of goodies. We had toboggan rides in deep snow with a full moon and coming back into a warm house with freshly fried home made doughnuts. The presents were a deep pile under the Christmas tree. The brothers and sisters were young adults filled with the positive energy of their early twenties."
1098,"The commander-in-chief took a largely jovial tone with Fallon, but turned serious as the two discussed the prostitution scandal that has marred the Secret Service that protects him."
1099,"Today is slightly colder and windier than the last few days but I can see and feel that spring is definitely on its way. I am so glad that it doesn't get dark so soon as it used to be some weeks ago, it means a lot to me that I still can enjoy the sunlight when I am home from work :)."
1100,Here are SOME of the things I have said I would do this year:
1101,"Wait, no, this game wasn't for me. It's something Mrs. Cranface was interested in. But as wonderful as she is (Mrs. Cranface, not Flo) I am not spending 4.2 cranzillion Microsoft credits on this game."
1102,"The preliminary questions ask, in essence, whether goods coming from a non-Member State which are copies of designs protected in the EU, such as Chinese shavers in Case C-446/09, or imitations of goods protected in the EU by trade marks, such as the mobiles inspected at Heathrow Airport, can be classified as ‘counterfeit’ or ‘pirated’ within the meaning of Regulation 3295/94, as amended by Regulation 1383/2003, considering that they are not released for free circulation in the EU territory but merely on the basis of the fact that they are brought into the customs territory of the EU, under a suspensive procedure referred to in Article 84 of the Customs Code. Indeed, in Case C-446/09, goods were under the customs warehousing procedure, therefore stored in a warehouse under customs supervision, and in Case C-495/09 goods were in external transit. The goods were counterfeit under EU or national law, but they were under customs procedures which did not entail the goods being put into commerce in the EU."
1103,His story reminded me of how I used to believe I had no imagination because when I was about seven my teacher had actually written in my report card
1104,"How come it's always feast or famine? Either I'm bored to the point of mental retardation at work, spending all my time e-mailing, IM-ing, web surfing and blogging OR I'm so fucking busy at work that I barely have time to go pee. And we all know how much I love to pee..."
1105,I went back to Runner’s Edge and told them about my experience. The guy told me I needed a shoe with a larger toe box so my toes would have more room. He set me up with a pair of Brooks Adrenaline GTS shoes. They felt great on my feet and had the support I needed. I’ve run many races in this model shoe and have been very happy with them. These became my shoe for the next seven years or so.
1106,"Tommy and I, assisted by my 10th former Roma, taught the boys about what it means to work as a team, qualities of an ideal leader, and how better to expess our feelings through words. I had 12 Boys give up the most beautiful, warm March Saturday to be inside speaking English and writing feeling poems. But in reality, they were really into all of the lessons and had a blast hanging out in a more causal and relaxed setting with Mr. Benjamin, Senor Tommy, and Roma."
1107,"The Beginning: Probably the most well known and established 'rookie' in terms of current business, Martin City Brewing Company was originally conceived back in Winter 2009 when co-owners Matt Murdick and Chance Adams decided to take their homebrewing to the next level. The restaurant, which Kansas City has already become familiar with, was established over the course of Spring 2011 and opened in June 2011 in order to ultimately fund the brewing part of the operation."

1109,"I was on my way to poker (third, grrrrrr. 2-fucking-AM I get home, for third, with no money). I kind of forgot about it today, but after the kids were asleep, I saw the towel draped over the sink reminding me not to run water down it. Weighing the options of trying it myself and calling an after-hours plumber, poverty won out, and I went to borrow a neighbor's pipe wrench. I think we have exactly one adjustable wrench, and a set of socket wrenches that I always forget we have. (I do have ""The Gator Grip,"" which is pretty much sufficient for all your wrenching needs, but I digress.) Anyway, we do not have a pipe wrench."
1110,"We decided our best course of action would be to head south to the bridge, then follow a trail as far south as we could before turning back north and following the river with the sun at our backs, both for the best photos, but also for the best light to view the birds at."
1111,"With a balanced throat chakra we “… tune into our own inner voice; it picks up our intuition and our spirit guides and angels.” This helps us tell the difference between our “ego” thoughts and our true messages and beliefs that come from within. Pg 143 Our intuition is not “an audible voice” but a subtle message. To increase your intuitive powers you will first need to be open to being an intuitive person. The second decision is to expect to be intuitive. “Expectation acts as a magnet for intuitive feelings.” 145/146. The third decision is to trust the feelings that you are opening to “because your intuitive feelings may not be supported by appearances or confirmed by others.” Pg 146 The fourth decision is “…to act on your intuition when it guides you.” “Making these four basic decisions – to be open, to expect, to trust, and to act on intuitive feelings, will create a direct conduit for your fifth chakra to communicate messages to you…” pg 146"
1112,"During the three seasons Rivaldo played for the Red-Whites, they won three league titles and two Greek cups. Rivaldo scored an impressive 43 goals in 94 games, came second in the top goalscorer charts in his final year as well as winning the league’s best foreign player award twice in 2006 and 2007."

1114,"My imagination runs WILD! There are many variations of a good plot, but it's the characters who tell the story. Characters are who readers fall in love with and remember long after the last punctuation mark. So, I'm always thinking of new characters...people I'd like to meet...and some I'd rather not, LOL."

1116,"A few minutes later and after the woman had eaten the piece of rib with an air of delight, I approached her and I subtly asked her if she was aware of what had just done because I had heard moments before making deep critical to smokers who were present, with the justification that the result of their action was extremely detrimental to the health of others."
1117,"I consoled myself with leg room which was all that remained of my earlier seat triumph, and the man to my left emitted the first in a 90-minute long sequence of meaty little burps."

1122,"Basically, I think I’ve spent the last 15 to 20 years being jaded about this picture presented to me as I grew up. At random times I would try to set out to prove my parents wrong: See! I can do what I love! I can become a struggling musician playing at dodgy pubs, trying to sing my pretty little acoustic ballads whilst truckloads of loud drunks tell me I sound like Jewel. Now that is fulfillment. I am a manifesting genius. I somehow managed to create experiences where no matter what I did, I always ended up feeling that life was hard, and I was its wounded suffering victim."
1123,"Banaian said, “My idea is that I’ve worked in serveral countries. I’ve given a lot of advice both on fiscal and monetary policies to federal and national governments in the past. I would then take that experience and go down to the legislature and then work with people who probably don’t agree with me.”"
1124,"Good morning everyone! Hope you're having a magnificent start to your Saturday!! I'm a little late in getting my post up this morning, so I apologize for that! It's time for a new challenge over at Kraftin' Kimmie's Challenge Blog, and this week our hostess with the mostest is the fabulous and awesomely talented Alice!! Alice makes the most amazing cards, and she has challenged us to a....are you ready????....a ONE LAYER CARD. Yup...you heard (or rather read) me correctly. LOL! A one layer card. Well anyone that has ever received (or maybe even weighed) one of my cards, knows how much of a challenge this was for me. But hey...isn't that what challenges are for? To stretch us out of our comfort zone? So I grabbed my cardstock and set out to do exactly that. And this is what I came up with."

1127,"The good news is that by Monday morning I was feeling much better - and ready to get back into the kitchen! Because I looooove the smell of fresh baked bread, because I'm a sucker for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and because it was Monday and just seemed like the right thing to do, I made a loaf of American style sandwich bread."
1128,"Finally, most of the bee keepers on the Yucatan are old men living in rural areas where no one inherits their knowledge of the fine points of meliponiculture, specifically, how to propagate bees by dividing nests. Earlier this year, Rogel Villanueva-Gutierrez, first author of the paper, with Stephen Buchmann, Arthur James Donovan and Roubik published an amply illustrated handbook, in Spanish and Mayan, with step by step instructions for basic stingless beekeeping."
1129,"If you, like me, have a penchant for old school photos, I can thoroughly recommend a visit to this edition of Alan Burnett's Sepia Saturday, where this week's charming image prompt depicts a group of young lads on a break from class, being asked to ""Look up"" by the photographer. A couple of them did! The rest ... well, they did what all school boys do when asked en masse to pose for a school photograph."

1132,"I think the storm (I hear they are called a microburst) lasted probably less than a minute but it felt like SO much longer. When it was all over everyone was safe but our camp was decimated. All of my stuff survived but only because we were on the side more sheltered by the trees, my siblings were not so lucky. Three tents were literally torn to shreds and their poles bent beyond repair. Everything we owned had sand in it. Even my camera which had been in my tent, in it's case, was full of sand. My sister's family spent the night in their van as nearly everything they brought was destroyed. The next day we packed up and left."
1133,"I haven’t seen my dad in days, but who cares? He’s the one at fault for this mess anyway. My cousin told me to check my new sister’s head for dents when she comes home. No one is amused when I repeat this information to my Nana’s Jehovah’s Witness friends. Nana threatens me with the yardstick."

1143,"Originally he was Eugene Vincent Craddock, a native of Norfolk, Virginia who didn't seem to like much beyond motorbikes and girls, and whose life was entirely unremarkable until the summer of 1955 when two events changed it forever. In July he was involved in a bike crash, one so bad that his left leg was almost severed below the knee. Then in September, with his whole leg in plaster, Gene went to see Elvis Presley play in Norfolk and had his mind blown. Elvis literally had his clothes torn off by rabid fans that night. Gene went home, picked up his guitar, and wrote Be Bop A Lula which he debuted at local radio station WCMS's talent show in January '56. By July it was a US Top Ten hit and Vincent was in demand, criss-crossing the States with his band the Blue Caps. His short life was suddenly mapped out for him."

1146,"Thankfully, not all games follow this pattern. Few exceptions include Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood and Mass Effect 3. Brotherhood introduces the most creative and unique mutliplayer of its time. It’s unfortunate that Ubisoft couldn’t continue to innovate with Assassin’s Creed: Revelations. Mass Effect 3 is also a noteworthy example. While wave-based co-operative gameplay is anything but new, Mass Effect 3 includes a multiplayer narrative that directly affects the single-player campaign. This satisfies the masses while placing a strong emphasis on the single-player experience. This form of innovation is what can truly change the industry in the coming generation."

1149,"I got a comment from Lori about how fast I'm accepting all this. Ironic, as I had been thinking the same thing. However, I have to realize that it wasn't in March, when M told me that she thought that she was confused that I knew this. I can look back and tell you that M was never your typical child. M was totally different. Sports was huge in M's life. M was also on the BOYS lacrosse team from 4th-the beginning season of 7th grade because they didn't have a girl's team until 8th grade. She did 8th, but hated it. She didn't like the girls' dynamics in both the sport or the attitude. Looking back, I can see the depression started when she quit the boys lacrosse. M was treated so poorly by the team, that she actually felt sexually harassed. When I confronted the coaches, they told her to go to the girls team. Back then I had a hard time dealing with anything that would be involving the law and ethics, so M just transferred to the girls' team, and enjoyed the first year. After 2nd year, M lost all interest in sports."
1150,"Discipline and control have always been my biggest challenges, and when the reserved and soft-spoken tell me they admire how I express myself, I tell them how I admire them, able to be calm, able to be quiet. I have to work hard at neatness of all kinds – in my house, in my communication, in my appearance, and in my demeanor."
1151,"Scattered around some of these homes, littering the lawns and driveways like nasty lawn ornaments, are numerous corpses. It is hard to tell if some of these corpses were zombies that were shot or if these corpses are the result of pitched battles. Probably a little of both I am guessing."

1164,"These were some lung-busting hills, ups and downs and perfect for the day’s prescribed hill fartlek workout. Lucho told me to push the hills to the top and recover on the flats and the downhills. I started on the Toyon trail and connected to the Los Trancos trail. It was a rolling, single-track trail with some of the hills lasting a mile or more, and the downhills were long and steep, leaf-covered trails shaded by tree canopies, beautiful twisting trails that my eyes took in ten feet at a time. I was pretty emotional on this run, thinking about Sharlie resting back at her temporary home, strapped to an oxygen machine and waiting for the call that would take her to the hospital and change her life forever. They told her it could come at anytime, but she may have to wait for months. I pictured her on the trails, walking slowly with her son to the lake, feeding the ducks and speaking in whispers as the fawn ate grass just below the trail. I also pictured her recovering here, with new lungs and a new heart, I pictured her running, and sharing the trail with me. I don't do much praying, but if I could will that to happen through prayer, meditation, or focused thought, Tuesday’s run may have helped push that dream a little closer to reality."

1174,"Perhaps the most interesting of that time were the Middle Eastern friends that suddenly arrived as a group one day. They appeared as a small gang of 8 and were obviously new to the country and culture here. My new interest in cultures had me being of the first to start befriending them and learning their story. They were in the first Iraq/USA war in the early 90s, but on the Iraqi side. The masses of approaching US troops and tanks forced realization of some Iraqis that they were outmatched and they surrendered. They would have been killed as surrendering traitors if they stayed in Iraq after that so the USA brought many of them here. The one I became very good friends with (Ahmed) told me many stories of his family, country, and wars he fought in as we sat at camp fires talking and drinking beers. I was his trusted advisor in career advancement, dating, and USA life in general and eventually his best man at his wedding. I haven’t talked with Ahmed for many years, but we both know the brotherhood we formed will last forever and I believe our paths will meet again. I think he eventually moved to Washington DC for a government job. I know his general determination in life will take him far."
1175,"So anyway, a big “THANK YOU” for having given me such a warm welcome to the group and for supporting me as I struggle through the challenges of always trying to make my art better and even remotely close to the standards we all have for ourselves as we paint and draw.

They also knew that they could never escape this place uless they destroyed the phylactery of Gagnasdiak. The tyrant hid a portion of his soul in this, the perfect hiding place, in a world where no life remained, there would be little risk of danger. They also knew that the tomb of Gagnasdiak was perilous and meant to trap souls within. They would not be blessed with the sweet release of death should they be caught in one of the nefarious traps or hazards of the tomb.

The term ""tapeña"" is a mix of ""tapas"" (small dishes of food) with ""peña"" (slang for a group of close friends). They make four wines, a Verdejo, Rosé, Tempranillo and Garnacha, and they are Vinos de la Tierra de Castilla, which means production is more flexible than under the regulations of the Denominacion de Origen system. The label is designed to look like a chalkboard, the type you would see at a Spanish restaurant presenting the daily specials, and the fork represents that they are food friendly."

You don’t feel that you are reading, you feel like you are being told a story and that is quite an achievement. Not all readers loved this book as much as I did. Their explanations are reasonable: the meandering nature of the work got to some, the seemingly constant digressions, its peculiarly eastern take on philosophy, the open-ended conclusion – all valid points. On Goodreads when I checked there were 97 reviews and their star-ratings are across the board; the dozen one-star reviews completely floored me though. I never expected to see that."

1222,"The high cost of college education often serves as a deterrent for many, in getting a higher degree, especially when it comes to students from low income families. After all, the high costs, education loans and the resultant debt can scare anybody. Sometimes, a student fresh out of high school may feel that he is still not sure what he wants to do in his life so how can he decide which degree to opt for. Other reasons for deciding against going to college are finding oneself too ill equipped to handle the studies and pressures of college life, and when nobody from the family has ever had a higher education."

Well, that is after I found it – for those new to the ExCeL convention centre, it is vast, with a main concourse running the length of the building, housing an extended food court. There were four conventions going on at the same time (including the ""2012 Zumba Instructors Convention”) and no obvious signage or information booth pointing out where the comics one was.

1232,"It may be argued that the course of action I am taking is founded upon fear, fear that Congress will again fail to act on the matter of appropriation, and it may be asserted that the members of the Congress are presumed to be as patriotic as the members of this Court, if not more, and that, therefore, we may rest assured that they will not fail to fulfill their duty. I admit this to be true, and accordingly, I ask what is then the hurry and necessity for nullifying the executive order on appropriation which we are sure will soon be substituted by a valid appropriation act? Why not defer judgment and wait until the special session of Congress so that it may fulfill its duty as it clearly sees it? I can find no reason against this suggestion except, perhaps, a desire to assert judicial supremacy in a case where judicial statemanship is more necessary."

They weren't totally eliminated from our tellies; they were just replaced mostly by imports from the old socialist bloc. So, instead of Huckleberry Hound and Yogi Bear, we had the Bolshevik Tio Stiopa (Uncle Stiopa), a tall and strong police officer who stood up for the weak and punished the bullies.

Ireland remains 6th out of 27 EU countries in financial wealth, but of course, this wealth is concentrated in a few hands. The Central Bank reported in May that there is €120 billion in Irish bank deposits – why could a wealth tax not be imposed on this rather than taking from households, from our education and health services? Massive natural gas and oil resources could also be explored for the benefit of Irish society, rather than for one or two multinationals."

The first three hundred words in that list make up more than half of all the written material contained in newspaper articles, magazines, text books, children’s books, stories, novels, and other written materials. I have arranged the spelling lists with a two hundred word count, which can be divided into groups of 10 to 20 words for about 10 to 20 weeks of work. I have added other words as well, including religious ones, to help round out the vocabulary. For preschoolers and kindergarteners, I recommend that you introduce the words about 10 at a time. First and second graders can probably handle 15-20 at a time, depending on their age and ability. Third and fourth graders should be able to handle 20 to 25 words at a time with no problem. If your child doesn’t know what a word means, let them look it up in a dictionary for vocabulary words. I recommend that your child write the words 5 times each to begin with. First graders and up should be able to put each word in a sentence, after that. Next a practice test should be given. Finally, any words missed in the practice test should be written an additional five times. The final spelling test should include both the correct words and the misspelled words from the practice test. You can carry over any misspelled words from the final test to the next test.

1344,Many people think of Poland as being a very grey country because the legacy of the 1980s pictures of the Solidaity riots in Gdansk hasn’t been replaced with any new reality. Unless you have been to Poland it’s easy to have this grey stereotype in your mind. Unfortunately Warsaw is not the best place to come if you want to develop a different image of Poland. It’s physical landscape consists of many types of blocks and many of these are grey. Many of the newer buildings are impressive architecturally like the beautiful Westin. In fact it is not so different to Tokyo which is unimpressive during the day but is saved by its lights at night. Perhaps Warsaw will one day also go down this route. In fact here are Japanese restaurants everywhere and girls dressed as cyber goths Tokyo style. Maybe Warsaw is on its way to becoming Europe’s Tokyo.

I felt that the characters I loved so much in Pride and Prejudice were missing from this book… especially when Elizabeth reflects that she wouldn’t have married Darcy without money. The true Elizabeth married for love and got money as a fun bonus – that’s the Austen way. This Elizabeth was not the same Elizabeth that I rooted for in Austen’s masterpiece.

1402,Here are some of my favourites from the sessions (I just love the Windy Bride story!):
1403,"Rel's head ached. His empty stomach clenched his gut like a fist. His wrenched shoulder held the tight sensation that presaged pain at the slightest hint of sharp movement, not helped by the stiff wrist from the earlier fight. The front of his brain felt cold and vacant, the back like a lump of wool. But the shining figure bearing down on him poured the warmth of familiar anger across everything, gave him strength. The Stable Rod, warm in his hand, promised a major advantage if it came to a fight, and he still had some Clearsight left, even with the Sherim pressing chaos against his mind."
1404,Here is a current list of things that I am all about at the moment:
1405,"3. We talk a lot about how ebooks are revolutionisng everything from publishing to the way we make marmite, it seems. But we are also seeing a rebirth in high quality handmade books go hand in hand with that. Here's one:"
1406,"However, one disadvantage comes from his lack of court experience. As with the Bonds Grand Jury, Sheridan’s questions were often imprecise and vague. Frequently the questions, especially when asked of his political or media opponents, were barely disguised polemic, perhaps designed to appeal to the jury. In addition, I imagine that, in conjunction with his remaining legal advisers, Mr Sheridan had decided by this stage not to give evidence himself. Therefore some of his questions would, either deliberately or sub-consciously, been designed to get his “evidence” across to the jury, although he would have been aware that the judge would direct the jury that his questions did not amount to testimony."

1411,"Raw feeders from “opposing” sides will argue about whether dogs are carnivores or omnivores (Dogs are carnivores) even though the definition itself doesn’t matter much. They get stuck into whether wolves eat the stomach contents of their prey and if not whether vegetables should be fed at all. And for me, every time the detail of this is raked over it (conveniently for the pet food industry) makes it much less painful for the undecided owner to stick with opening that bag of kibble."

I fed him, I let him see his mother off (because he usually behaves when he sees for himself that she’s not in the house), and when he got fussy I put him to bed. Everything was good until he awoke from his nap earlier than he should have. Right away, Benjamin went to crying. No problem. I changed his diaper and that should have been the end of that. It wasn’t time for him to eat so he should have been good, but Benjamin kept crying. His mother usually rocks him and walks around with him so I decided to try that.

I´m sorry, if anyone who reads this likes that style, if you do, skip this paragraph, because I don´t and i am going to complain a little about it.

I checked the clock and it was about 11:00. I asked the ladies in there several questions about the process. I was very unfamiliar with what was going to happen. They were very helpful. At this point I am thinking that I would be in there no more than 2 or 3 hours. I am honestly still contemplating finishing up my shopping trip today. But time ticked and ticked and ticked.

Poop does defy gravity when it comes out of a baby’s butt while seated. Now just imagine trying to take the onesie covered in poop off of your baby. Poop in the hair only comes out after 3 baths, so bring the scissors and cut just above the poop line. And then gladly say goodbye to that oh-so-cute onesie you thought you would eventually bronze. No, it can’t be salvaged, so just trash it. You have at least 75 onesies your grandmother’s aunt’s coworker gave you, so get over it. Oh and the towel is to temporarily cover up the poop that you’ll have to hose off the car-seat later."

The resulting beers have been surprisingly good, and my husband now seems determined to work beer into even the mundane parts of life. He would probably clean floors with blonde ale and brush his teeth with lager if I let him. But beer has truly found a place in our kitchen, where Husband finds ingenious ways to fit it into new recipes. This recipe is for Wienerschnitzel vom Schwein (which means “Viennese breaded pork”) and my husband’s crisp honey lager makes an appearance in the breading. He chose to serve it with a sour cream and dill sauce, but sauce for schnitzel comes in a nearly infinite number of variations.

I have good experience in restoring 78's but the soundtrack disks seems to be a bit different, and they should be. I did however apply a slight pop-filter to eliminate the most apparent pops and crackles. I also lowered the over all noise level with about 6dB to make the dialogue stand out, but that's all."

Probably John Carter would have sold more tickets if it had a simpler us vs. them story to sell. Obama would probably have a higher approval rating too. Voters, like theater audiences, like things simple."
1533,The journey to success is never easy no matter the route you take and one has to be of a very strong character to persevere. I always say failure is just a challenge but giving up is for the weak.

1536,"But there is another clue. Where were the disciples when the Lord departed from them? Look at verse twelve. “ Then returned they unto Jerusalemfrom the Mount called Olivet.” They were on the Mount of Oliveswith the Lord and they were on the Mount of Oliveswhen the Lord departed from them. His departure was from the Mount of Olivesbut what about His Second Coming? Go back to Zechariah 14:4 and it tells us, “His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the east.” When He returns, His feet will touch the same place as they last stood on the earth, on theMount of Olives. That was the place He gave to His disciples that great Olivet discourse in Matthew 24:3-25:6. Now that is His Second Coming."
1537,"I also spent all day Friday piecing together a king size quilt for my Aunt Sandie. It seems that my mom has passed her over when it comes to the quilt making area. So she needed my help to put it together for her. SO does it count if I made it and she bought the material? I'm not sure. But I baste it and quilt it this week, along with some other quilts that I need to get done. So pictures to come. Sorry Sandie! :D But you will love it!"

1539,"My pillows! I always take my pillows with me on a road-trip (except of course when I fly). I’m really picky about sleeping on “used” pillows. I can’t help wondering who slept on the fluffy mound before me, whether they had clean hair or bad breath or whatever! And besides, no pillow can ever be quite as comfortable as my own. (Now you can see why I wouldn’t have made the trip west in a covered wagon–at least not without a great deal of complaining and whining!)"

1545,"My perspective, from the booth we were given (we do a trade deal with Popkomm, which represents at the SXSW trade fair), may have been skewed. We were almost in the corner of the hall, not terribly visible, between a royalty-collection service and an only-in-Germany merchandise provider called Deaf and Dumb, who were giving away t-shirts featuring a huge, well, it was hard to tell what it was, which wasn't a great advertisement for their printer. It appeared to be a star with wings, and I guess that's what it was. Once their freebie t-shirts ran out, so did their visitors. I wonder if they are even minimally aware of how bad the name of their company is: not only is it offensive to handicapped people (having had a father with tympanic sclerosis, I'm maybe a bit sensitive to all issues around hearing-loss), but giving a company a name which implies it can't hear you and is stupid to boot can't bring in many English-language-savvy customers. We were directly across from Music Catalonia!, whose impressive booth featured a mirrored wall with the group's logo on it, and it was a gas watching people coming into the hall stop to check that their image was right before walking on."

Anybody who has a 3-year-old (or 4 or 5-year-old) knows that children at this age can seem terribly grown up one moment and so very young the next. That is why many children this age will still seek out a bottle, dummy (pacificier) or thumb. They still seek the comfort that breastfeeding provides, whether or not they actually receive this comfort at the breast."

1561,"“Furry?” answered Praymar. “I should think not,” answered Praymar not getting the jest and brushing his long white bangs back with his right hand. He was thin fellow, with high cheekbones and thin red lips. Despite his unusual coloring, he was a rather handsome looking youth, probably no older than fourteen."

1572,"There is something liberating, enlightening, about sitting still by choice. Watching the street for hours, staring at the ceiling listening to a new playlist, picking at the strings on the hem of my shorts, or reading a really good book straight through. The world stops. I don’t know about you, but I have always wanted the world to slow down just for a moment, hold on…. wait for me to really really enjoy this moment, make it last. Today, my one chapter turned into 2, then 3, then the whole freakin book. I only got up to get a drink. The world around me stopped. The phone didn’t need to be answered, no one missed me on facebook or anywhere else for that matter…. no one needed me, or anything from me and for one full looooong moment the world was mine. My choice. And I loved it."
1573,"I base my opinion on the results of a recent survey of human couples in long-term relationships. It appears that the women said regular sex was essential, whereas the men said they needed to be kissed and cuddled. After pinching myself to make sure I wasn’t in a parallel universe, I realised what must have happened. The women were so worried about appearing needy and emotional that they pretended to be men, while the men were so fearful of looking like heartless lechers that they pretended to be women. The result of all this disinformation was a report with findings that would make a baboon chortle."

After a couple quick back and forth comments, it got me wondering if it wasn't so much peach beers but ""clean"" peach beers that wouldn't work. Maybe there was something to a sour that could make the peach flavor shine? (I should note Mike also suggests using white peaches, not yellow)"
1580,"You're right about the Greek mythology too. Throughout Haywired there are a few nods to Greek history and mythology. If you know your Greek myths, you can even take a stab at the twist with regard to Hephaestus and the HELOTs, which was intentional. I love books that can be understood in different ways depending on what you know. Again, Pratchett is brilliant for this. His books are great fun, but as you get older and learn more, you realise there is so much more going on. I wanted Haywired to have that ability."

In particular, this means developing an integrated approach to health services that will build on primary and community services so that people can get treated at home or in the community where appropriate rather than coming into hospital. This, in turn, will allow us at Middlemore to concentrate on providing the high quality complex care that the hospital is equipped for."

1592,"She was staring directly at my erect cock as she masturbated. I was so turned on by her looking at me I had to grasp my cock and seek relief from the arousal that threatened to split my penis open in its erection. I wrapped my hand around my swollen cockhead and began to jerk and tug it. She intently watched me as she did herself. In a few minutes she shuddered demurely as I watched her face contort in her orgasm. It was such a turn on to see her cum; the electric jolt of my own orgasm would not be denied anymore. A few moments later as she watched me transfixed in the final throes of her own crisis, I hurled a long thick string of cum onto her breasts, which was followed by a few more spurts that landed on her belly. She ran her fingers though the still warm cum on her nipple and tested it between her thumb and forefinger and then spread it on her nipple. She pulled my head to her nipple and asked me to suck it off which I did dutifully. This was the first time I ever licked my own warm cum off of a woman’s nipple, something that I still relish doing today with my wife."

1606,"Corin Roscoe, an antiques store owner, is a man fighting fears relatable to us all: ones with family, with friends, with God. His days are haunted with harsh realities and his nights by dreams of horrific incidents endured. He reaches many crossroads in this book: does he hang onto fear or face it? Hang onto guilt or seek forgiveness? Deny the truth or accept it? And when life offers him a choice between the easy road or the high road–when the easy road will spare him further struggles–which does he choose?"
1607,"When we deal with the Sacred Host, the Eucharist, we must link to the Passion. And such a link is even more easily made when one considers the Eucharistic miracle of Orvieto – when a priest who had doubts about the Blessed Sacrament was given the consolation of seeing drops of blood fall onto the corporal after he pronounced the words of Consecration."
1608,"Look, I get that some people don’t understand that being who you are isn’t really a choice. However, you either be yourself, or you pretend you’re someone else and suffer-along in life. Maybe I should put things into my own perspective…"
1609,"I think I'm quite lucky to have a pharmacist that speaks English at a pharmacy near my school. I can't even begin to imagine trying to act out or gesture medical symptoms to someone who speaks no English in hopes that they will be able to decipher my motions correctly and give me medicine that will actually help my ailment. Nevertheless, I'm always pretty apprehensive to take Korean medicines that I've picked up at the pharmacy or gotten at a doctor's office. More times than I can count, one of my co-workers has come back from the doctor's office with a Ziploc baggy of 40-50 unlabeled pills and instructions to take these pills together twice a day and these other 2 pills every third day or something like that. What boggles me even more is the fact that most of my co-workers begin popping these pills without a second thought about what they might be."

1613,"Also, many people in the 'good old days' worked till they dropped not by choice, but out of grim necessity. In the early 1900s there was no social security. And most 'conservatives' would say that this was a good thing, a praiseworthy thing; rugged individualism, self-reliance, no old-age ''welfare deadbeats'' being coddled."
1614,"Those of us who are writers have probably all had trouble getting words down at one point or another. I can tell you from personal experience I go through a small bout of writer’s block at least once a week. I’ve learned that it’s quite normal for this to happen. I try not to let it frustrate me, but as writing is one of the main things that I do in order to keep myself healthy and balanced these days, I can’t help a bit of scowling, nail biting and frustrated pacing at my own sort of mental constipation."

I also have a bottle of the Basic G to try out in the bathrooms, but I haven't made it in there just yet. I was more concerned about the kitchen at that point."
1618,"Sports and healthcare PR seem like the most obvious choice for someone who is interested in both PR and health and fitness, but I’m not entirely sold on these paths. Sports PR entails some rough hours that would be fun while I’m young, but when I have a family it will be tough. Healthcare PR sounds like a decent fit for me, too, but nonprofit work is difficult. I’d be up for the challenge, but I think there might be another choice out there that may suit me a little better."

The verse I think, goes perfectly with the title ""He Knows my Name"" which came to me after asking God what I should name it. I was really excited when the next day (today!) I sat down to do my bible study and that very same verse was one that I had to read. I love it when God does that, I guess He's trying to tell me something! The study I am doing is ""lies Women Believe and the Truth that Sets Them Free"" Two of the truths I learned today are:"

1644,A boost to the use of photographs by the Church during the post World War 2 New Life Movement saw the formation of the Publicity Department and the appointment of Lindsay Crozier as the Church’s Photographer in 1950. The Photographic Unit operated until the late 1980s when it closed due to financial pressure. During the 37 years the unit produced a wonderful visual history in a variety of media highlighting the Church’s work throughout New Zealand and overseas. The records and catalogues they maintained eased the burden of identification in contrast to the earlier photographic record which required Donald to undertake considerable research to place them in context.

All-wheel drive and an eight-speed transmission transmit its power to the road with unshakable precision. This is a Bentley that can both stir the soul or calm the spirit, according to the mood of the driver or the conditions."

It's the Jack-in-the-box that was used to scare her in the first scene. She walks up to it, and sloooooooooooooowly begins to turn the crank.

1656,"That's a big fear starting out. Who cares about me and what I have to say? That's probably why I've waited so long to get this blog started. I procrastinated a lot. I procrastinated with my website and with Facebook, too. I am more of a solitary person, which is one of the reasons I like to write. It's an intimate experience."
1657,"My uncle lives very close to the castle...anytime I walk 'doon the toon' I pass right by it. I am looking forward to a week of Irn Bru, fish & chips with mushy peas, visits with cousins, big burly accents and Coronation Street in real time.

1658,"If I could give one directive in the political party this MP belongs to, I would ban him from participating in public protests in future. That is to protect his personal integrity as well as the image of the party. I don’t think the guy is able to control himself in a huge crowd in public."
1659,"While in high school, I wrote. I had taken journalism and the teacher loved my writings. Two pieces of my work had been published in two different school publications. I was also asked to join the staff for the school paper, but declined. I just didn’t like writing the things wanted for a paper. I liked creating stories to take you places. Inventing new worlds and people to live in them. I stopped writing after getting out of school and didn’t start again for several long years."

1664,55. Secretary (James Spader) – The hottest sex scene I’ve ever seen. And very weird.
1665,have to admit they are so much more fun then model airplanes.
1666,"All my life. My aunt who lived in Miami would send me these snail mail coupons: ""One 100-word story about your weekend entitles you to your Beanie Baby of choice, to be redeemed by the end of the month."" Are you kidding?? Sign me up STAT! I'll tell you all about my lame weekend :D"

1668,"The Texas State Fair was always the biggest state fair in the United States. (Everything has always been bigger in Texas.) We always had the most fun on the Midway, or, if not it was because we ran out of money, money for food, for games, for rides and for shows, and we’d sneak in where we could, so that we could have more money for more food, more games, more rides and more shows. We’d of course spend most of our money on serious eats such as Frito pie and corn dogs or the latest widgets and whirligigs. It took all day to see it all, the statues, the barns, the science exhibits, and the famed Cotton Bowl, and…and…and… Or, if we wanted a little excitement we could take in Joie Chitman’s Thrill Show or the Sky Review; or for music go see “The King and I,” which had just come to the music hall in 1954. Sometime around then they brought Big Tex up to date. They made him talk. Then before you knew it they put him on WRR, broadcastin’ live from the State Fair of Texas. You could also catch the Blues. “This is WRR broadcastin’ live from Fair Park and we’re proud to present Mr. Ray Charles.” Whereupon the best we could do was acknowledge how big Mr. Ray Charles really was."

1676,"Happy New Year! 2011 was as busy and exciting as I hoped it would be at the end of 2010. 4 client debuts and 17 client books in all were published, and I sold 9 debuts, and made 11 other deals, not including foreign deals and film options. I attended the Bologna Book Fair for the first time in March and the Storymaker's Conference in Utah in May where I got to see the Wells brothers and where I found three new clients, definitely a conference record for me."

1679,"So, President Obama makes history by appointing his second top general during wartime in less than two years; despite what his most avid supporters want to claim, he doesn't get credit for firing his second top general during wartime (he fired Gen. David McKiernan in the spring of 2009 and appointed McChrystal)."
1680,We love her so much
1681,"One thing that puzzles me is why no one has ever mentioned tubular breasts to me. I had one breast exam done in my teen years, and at least once at the beginning of each pregnancy. Have none of these doctors seen this before? Why hadn't one, just one, person said something? I realize nothing can be done but I spent many nights crying because I couldn't breast feed and felt I had selectively just given up, and that my body was normal. I had to discover this on my own and I just hope other women out there with the same condition are able to find the resources they need."
1682,In My Time of Dying
1683,It is commonly claimed that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon. This is false. None of the Apollo astronauts reported seeing any man-made object from the Moon. The misconception is believed to have been popularized by Richard Halliburton decades before
1684,This Psalm guards the entrance into the Psalm book. It is the first idea we encounter as we get ready to enter into the book. This psalm will guide our understanding and control our interpretation and our singing and praying of the rest of the Psalms in the book.
1685,"We rented kayaks one day and traveled the mangrove lined exterior of the island, and got great views of the basketball sized star fish under water. We also got to do some more scuba diving. We signed up with a friendly local company and were on a boat with only two other people. The boat rides to the dive spots are a little longer here than in Roatan so they mostly do two tank dives. This means that you do two separate dives (one tank each), and take a small break in between on the boat. The water and reefs are different here, but have their own unique beauty. We enjoyed experiencing the underworld with creatures such as nurse sharks, big lipped groupers, spotted eagle rays, yellow fin tuna, and sea turtles. One loggerhead sea turtle we saw was so huge we referred to him as grandpa, because he’s got to be old."
1686,"Well , glad that's over and not all in a bad way."
1687,"Also, we didn't exactly pack right. Two weekends ago, we came here to house hunt. We left Tuesday, got back around 11pm then had to drive another 2hrs home (airline tickets were $400 cheaper here) which got us home at 3am. Then the packers came bright and early 8am the next day. They packed up everything in sight. Even Jacks diapers. I went in to change him and she had already snatched them up. I was kinda mad. I mean, I have a baby, he wears diapers, why pack them up? And they also got to our clothes before we knew what was going on. So all my cold weather stuff is now sitting in a storage unit. And it's oh 30 something degrees here! When we left GA, it was like 80. And we chose here? But it should start getting warmer soon. Right? It is almost April..."

1689,"“You can ask the Bangladeshis, if they want to go back, they can go back. But I believe that 100 percent of them would not agree to go back."
1690,"I’ve come out of my shell and I’ve become more objective. I know beautiful moments when I see them and appreciate them all that I can. But in the silence of a great moment underappreciated, I don’t fret. I take my reaction for what it is, consider the context, and move on. I’ve always been good at letting people love me. I trust easily. And I definitely know how to love others. But loving and accepting myself? I think that was only skin deep before I came here."
1691,"Sometimes on his way home he'd stop at Bagleys, which was the fine jewelry and china store in town. He'd walk in, sunburned, perhaps trailing grains of sand, wearing his moccasins and a white t-shirt, and, as he always told the story (and he told it more than once), the snooty Bagleys personnel would look down their nose at him and say, ""Can I help you?"" clearly thinking that he had no money for their fine things. But my mother's birthday is in August, and Guv would look around at the bone china and the Limoges porcelain and the gold jewelry, and he would buy her something."
1692,"In December, at a public meeting in Westminster organised by SPUC, Mrs Clarke spoke out about her worries regarding sex education in schools. She said that her son’s behaviour changed radically for the worse after he was exposed to sex education at school. Mrs Clarke, who also runs a charity for child sex abuse victims, said that sex education puts children in a vulnerable position because the material used is basically paedophilic."
1693,“The greatest thing that I have learned is probably the simplest thing any of us can learn: I am who I am.”
1694,"You see, I work in an elementary school, and our students are of the age when it's a complete delight to reflect on God's goodness by celebrating the first Thanksgiving in American history."
1695,"But come Armageddon, Rudolf, Christmas Mouse, Mutant Mutt, Frosty and his Mini-Me will be grateful for Brenda’s indoor/outdoor turf carpeting. Those synthetic fibers are guaranteed to survive anything short of a direct hit from an atom bomb. Plus, the wood paneling on the wall is actually made of Laminex® – wipes clean and blocks radiation!"
1696,"This thriller isn't always thrilling, but it's not bad either. Pamela Franklin is beautiful and natural as Jane, while Michele Dotrice as Cathy is not quite as beautiful or talented, but she shows a little bit more skin to make up for it. Sandoe Eles, who plays Paul, seems like a real cool character, smooth and shadowy at the same time. All of the locals are a little off-kilter, and you get the sense that all of them are hiding something, and any one of them could be behind Carol's disappearance."

1700,"The kids I nanny, B&K, wanted to do a paint project yesterday, so I thought it would be fun to make something for their mom, for Mother’s Day (hello, it’s on Sunday!). First we consulted Pinterest and found some cute inspiration, but we wanted to branch out a little on our own, too. K decided she wanted to ‘foot’ paint a butterfly and ‘hand’ paint a sun…a really cute summer day scene. B decided that he wanted to do a couple of flowers with his hands and feet! I love doing finger painting activites, but make sure you keep some towels and paper towels close by because it gets messy (although washable paint is great, we still don’t like it covering everything!)."
1701,"In an emergency, though, I can somehow function all right. Gratefully these do not happen often, as I crash hard afterwards."

1704,"Four students, who sustained bullet injuries, were out of danger, the sources said."
1705,"I was very happy there. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t all sugar and daisies. Every school has bullies, and every school has a popular crowd. The social ladder just wasn’t as high there, and it was much easier for everyone to be themselves. I was able to get away from the nicknames and rumors I had grown up with, and have a bit of a fresh start. I made new friends, and had a decent social circle of fun, silly, lovable people."

1709,"Lastly, I’m Pro-Life. I think that I need to discuss this since this issue has been one of the hottest issues in politics not only in the Philippines but also in other countries such as the United States of America. People, abortion is murder, probably the worst kind of murder since the victim cannot defend himself or herself from the assailant, plain and simple. And please tell me, how one can be Pro-Choice when he or she is depriving another living entity of a choice?"

1711,"Swiping to the left across the keyboard deletes your last input for instance, while swiping up changes to the numeric/symbol keyboard. That same swipe up gesture is used when the keyboard attempts to guess the word you’re typing — according to Bhardwaj, users will be able to send those guessed words flying into their messages by swiping from where the word appears over keys."
1712,"Umbrella is the story of a little girl, Momo, who is oh-so-excited about her birthday presents. On her third birthday, Momo received red rubber boots and an umbrella. But Momo has to learn some patience. For the rain is SLOW in coming. And her parents aren't going to be easily persuaded that her umbrella is a must for dealing with sun and wind."
1713,"As we always get with Tarantino flicks, there are plenty of homages and influences seen here and they all work perfectly. The whole film is basically one big kung-fu movie that reminded me of the days when I would just sit home and watch all of these Bruce Lee flicks where he would be either taking on 50 dudes at once (no homo), or he would be getting kicked in the chest by one of Lew Alcindor’s big feet. I can definitely tell that Tarantino did the same thing when he was a little kiddy and his inspiration just runs throughout this whole flick with a giddy and original feel to it. However, it’s not just kung-fu movies that this flick seems to be harking back to, you get a bunch of blaxploitation homages, spaghetti western moments where the score is just over-powering, a random ass anime scene that may seem weird but is just as brutal as the rest of the flick, and even a little bit of nods to his own previous work such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. I don’t know how he does it but Tarantino is the master at taking everything he knows and loves about movies, and putting them all into one crazy and madly original flick."

And a discovery by Violet, that Tate is actually Constance’s son (though we’d already worked that one out as they do look very similar)."
1720,"Project Payday gives people who are interested in making money by trying products a forum in which to find that type of work. It doesn’t cost any money to sign up with Project Payday, so it can’t hurt to at least check it out and see what you think."

1722,"While I'll appreciate further reports (and learn more on further visits), the food seems like good, if somewhat predictable, fare. I had a honey mustard chicken sandwich that was perfectly cooked, moist, and tender. Sally had pizza, which turned out to be thick crust--not to my personal taste. However, it is hand made and seemed like it might have been made with beer and is pretty tasty, particularly loaded, as it was, with tasty veggies."
1723,"I can safely say that the summer of 09/10 will forever be associated with not only the opening tune – you know, daa daa, da-da-da-DAH-da, da-da-da-DAAH-da, da, da, da-dah, but the background music that seems to play throughout all three films."
1724,What you choose to put in will have a direct effect on your progress both physically and spiritually.
1725,"Saturday we went on a bike ride with Maddy and Eric from Hermosa to Venice Beach. Round trip that's about a 20 mile bike ride. When we finished Chad told me how proud he was that I finished it, thanks babe for literally pushing me through some rough spots. Venice Beach has the best people watching ever. There are so many oddballs up there its crazy. It really is pretty dirty though and a little sad, so many young homeless kids strung out on drugs trying to make some money. But then you also have your street performers and freak shows that are great entertainment."

1731,"Our main flock are Dorset Downs, which give a rich cream wool. We used this and wool from the chocolate-black Hebridean sheep, to create resilient chunky and aran yarns. The Jacobs, with their smart black and white patched coats have been used to make pretty grey aran and double knitting yarns. The Shetlands have a softer, finer fleece with a longer staple and they come in lots of colours. From them we have moorit (natural rich brown), white and a soft brown from a blend of fawn, cream and moorit fleeces. This and the hebridean black are available in both double knitting and 4-ply to allow people to create lighter, more delicate finished articles."

1737,"So, to put it in real world terms; the gorgeous cloudy amber colour is backed up by a nose full of orange blossom honey, with a hint of an earthy spice. The beer then develops a BIG orange & candied tangerine peel on the palate with a very pleasing hint of dill that arrives just before the serious citrus bitter kicks in, it's not an unpleasantly strong bitter but it's pretty prevalent nonetheless."
1738,"“Oh yes. This rustic style really isn’t for me. Still, I suppose I shouldn’t complain. Most people would be thrilled to inherit a big farmhouse in the woods.” Izzy’s mother sighed as if to say she did not count herself as one of these people. “Before we inherited the house, the last time we were here was when Izzy was born. Right over there in the living room, as a matter of fact.”"
1739,"There’s a reason for the inconsistency of these accounts: shariah scholar payments don’t have to be made public. And while conventional bankers have found themselves the target of a forceful backlash against bonuses, the quieter but equally insistent voices calling for limits to the influence and payment of shariah scholars struggle to find a platform."

1761,Even my 7-year old nephew was trying to contemplate the fact that he was going back home to Manila already. I bet he couldn't believe it too. There's no excitement of going back home when you don't have anyone to go back to anyway. Because the my parents and me are still staying here in the states for another two months.
1762,"At least one reader felt that my solution to yelling in my post ""You can stop yelling at your children"" was trite. For parents who are just trying to get through the day any advice can sound unrealistic. The feeling of ""that's easy for you to say...."" bubbles quickly to the surface. My closing, ""You can stop yelling at your children. Start by focusing on your relationships, letting go of your expectations and meeting the needs of each family member"" would have pushed my buttons when I was struggling through each day with three children ages 4 and under. I would have told you that all I did was meet my family's needs: laundry, dishes, cooking, nursing, and changing diapers. If you felt that way about the post, I hope you will go back to it and click on some of the links to past blogs. The past blogs go into more detail and explain what I meant by focusing on relationships, and to which expectations and needs I was referring."

Abbey has NEVER slept during a carride with us. He wrote about how well she did upon arriving at his home, making herself comfortable with his other dog and happily chowing down on a bone, even TRADING bones with her new furry sister.

THQ recently complained about their poor sales, both of their insane drawing tablet device and of their often terrible childrens licensed properties.

1782,"And lest we think zombie was Polis’s only euphemism here, let’s remember that earmark already refers to pigs (or other herd animals). The machine were are all hooked to is a political beef-jerkery in which, of course the earmarks are zombies, recycled year after year, for voters who are also kinds of zombies, working, being taxed and paying for the earmarked economy, they are zombies, churning away in the Haitian sugar-mills, building highways to nowhere. All of law is just a bunch of Congressional earmarks packaged together. Earmarks is how you keep the pigs counted before you grind them to sausage. Which is how you make law in a corrupt democracy of apathetic unaware zombie citizens, right before they grind them to sausage too."
1783,"The raw material of news must pass through successive filters, leaving only the cleansed residue fit to print.

With some changes and adaptations in thinking, these could easily reflect the role of the parent; I know many, many families in which this is true."
1793,"Contrariwise, I arrived yesterday with a determined, pleasant attitude. In response, most of my employees and coworkers exhibited a similar attitude. The workload was the same as it was on Friday which meant that we would be spread thin by performing three autopsies simultaneously all day without a break. The stress level was equally as high. The difference: we each took control of our attitudes and were champions for one another."
1794,"We ordered pulled pork sandwiches with cole slaw and tempura sweet potatoes with Tennessee sauce, as well as smoked brisket and chicken with collard greens. This has got to be the best BBQ I've ever tasted. It has set the standard for Atlanta, and I hope everyone else rises to meet this challenge.

1797,"I went to see UNSTOPPABLE the other day and it was OK, but it was one of those films that made me think of what it could have been. Tony Scott directed it, so you know what you’re going to get. I like his movies, more recent ones especially. He directs action. Things move, and they move fast. Things blow up, and they blow up big. He’s all about energy and speed and action."
1798,"So, Chef Boyardee tastes good. It has ""vegetables"" in it. Kid finds out about ""vegetables."" Chef Boyardee no longer tastes good? This commercial is delving into some serious quantum-mechanics shit by suggesting that knowledge of a food can change its properties. Perhaps they took a lesson from the space-time bending properties of Sabra."
1799,"As an example, something I was talking to a fellow blogger about the other day comes to mind. Every year I am in a panic when it comes to certain vegetables whose seed I have yet to start saving on a regular basis...like onion seed. I often have a real dickens of a time getting my onion seed in a timely manner regardless of how soon I order it and the varieties of storage onions that grow well for us are very limited...there's like three of them. I have started ordering a couple years worth of the seed just in case but onion seed has a pretty short term viability of around 1-2 years after which the germination rate decreases significantly. So I feel the strong need to save my own and relieve myself of this yearly allium hysteria. We want to have seed and food sovereignty."
1800,"So why isn't there an outrage when people hire such get-ups for party-wear? Simply the caprice of human nature. The further the deeds of the past recede, the fewer can be bothered being passionate about them. This is the inevitable and necessary process of forgetting the fine detail. We couldn't remain aware of and enraged by every turn of history's pages and have time to live our own lives."

1821,"For those who aren't facebook friends or real life friends, short version of what's going on. My mom had a major stroke on March 29, her left side is paralyzed and it pretty much killed off her entire right side of the brain. She was still alert though that Tues and Wed and we thought OK that's a good sign. Little did we know that would be the (currently) last time we would see her that alert. Thurs she started going downhill, and by Friday afternoon she was non responsive and what we know now, basically in a coma. She stayed that way through the following Tues, which the doctors finally did another CT Scan. Come to find out she had another stroke over the weekend, this time on the left side of her brain. Thankfully it wasn't major. When you have a stroke, the brain swells, and pushes against the good part of the brain, thus causing it to lose function as well. She had major swelling on the right side, and slight swelling on the left side. Tuesday the doctors told us that she'd most likely only live a few more days. She was deteriorating rapidly and nothing seemed to be getting better. She spent that entire weekend in AFIB and that is what caused the two strokes."
1822,But back to my point. Ongoing change presents us with real problems. Doing what is sensible for our business in the “here and now” is not necessarily what prepares it best for the “tomorrow and beyond”. Indeed doing what seems logically right today can be exactly the opposite of what is good for the long-term.

1903,"The individual feels the futility of human desires and aims and the sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves both in nature and in the world of thought. Individual existence impresses him as a sort of prison and he wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole. The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear at an early stage of development, in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. Buddhism, as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer, contains a much stronger element of this."

Instead I turn to the the brilliant documentary 'Stepping Razor Red X - The Peter Tosh Story' directed by Nicholas Campbell and released in 1993 to tell the story. In fact, the power of the documentary is that it is told through Tosh's own words which he kept in a series of cassette tapes he recorded that were discovered after his death. (read a New York Times review of the film which helps put the documentary into context). The film succeeds in providing a detailed look at Tosh that is distinct and separate from the role he played in founding The Wailers and further helps to portray him as a separate musical personality with political and social viewpoints which clashed with that of the Jamaican establishment and government."
1919,As we try to fathom our contemporary situation we see everything that once gave us our bearings is being broken down. Our natural society made up of homogeneous communities is being de-constructed for the creation of a pre-meditated artificial society. The task for us writers is to try explain what is happening and not just to react to events but articulate what we need for our rebirth from the ashes of our old traditions. There are two main aspects: A spiritual defence and a practical defence. This is about the spiritual defence my next article will deal with the practical defence.

1938,"During this time, peaceful occupiers have been faced with continual harassment arrests, almost invariably on fabricated charges (“disorderly conduct,” “interfering with the conduct of a police officer”—the latter a charge that can be leveled, for instance, against those who try to twist out of the way when an officer is hitting them.) I have seen one protestor at Union Square arrested, by four officers using considerable force, for sitting on the ground to pet a dog; another, for wrapping a blanket around herself (neither were given warnings; but both behaviors were considered too close to “camping”); a third, an ex-Marine, for using obscene language on the Federal steps. Others were reportedly arrested on those same steps for singing a satirical version of the “Officer Krumpke” song from West Side Story. Almost no march goes by without one or two protestors, at least, being hurled against vehicles or have their heads bashed against the ground while being arrested for straying off the sidewalk. The message here is clear. Law has nothing to do with it. Anyone who engages in Occupy Wall Street-related activity should know they can be arrested, for virtually any reason, at any time."

Also, drop me a comment to let me know what you all would like to see in the way of stamps for Manic Monday. I love to hear all of your great ideas for stamps!"
1954,"In other news, US President Barack Obama has received a wave of support after throwing his support behind marriage equality for same-sex couples. It’s a courageous move in a nation known for its obsessive religious fundamentalism. Closer to home, it’s a move which re-affirms just how out of step Julia Gillard is, with the majority of Australians on this issue."
1955,out loud. Words take up too much room.
1956,"Besides, if you have a good install base, why do you need any further appeal to publishers? And that’s all this would appeal to. Publishers. Sony has more than enough tech from their other divisions to make an incredibly advanced and affordable PS4 that would leave Microsoft in their tracks, so they don’t need to do this."

1959,"Moggies of Malvern is a strange old place. Over the last 5 years of getting my lunch here, I've seen people with at least 16 items try to use the self service checkout, people with less than 16 items try to use the self service checkout but without a basic understanding of barcodes, menu navigation and weight measurement, an ordinary looking man using a trolley for a paltry two loaves of bread and other stunning examples of Jesus Weptery that really are too depressing to recount."

1965,"An Italian traditional New Year's Eve meal is not complete without a serving of lentils. In fact last night we learned of a dilemma on the local news: 'cenone' (mega dinner) or discothèque? We were amused. People were interviewed in the streets of Cortina and answered earnestly, faces hard. What will we do? Are we doing the right thing? (Cameras swerving from portions of 'zampone e lenticchie' to flashing disco lights over bronzed babes.)"

1967,"Everyone knows that you can find the best deals on computers and electronics online. Wouldn’t it be nice to find those same massive discounts on things like designer clothes, jewelry and watches or women’s shoes? The fact is that you can. Over the past five years or so, the internet marketplace has undergone its own Big Bang, and the result is a whole universe of shopping choices for all the things that you want most. That only leaves one question – where are all the bargains?"
1968,"I didn’t go to Potsdam today, as I had said last night. I thought there was a guided tour through the same company that did my regular walking tour, but it turned out I had misread the brochure and those tours are on Sundays, not Saturdays. Tant pis.

1986,"The example I like to use is the following as it is the community I live in: Alameda, where I live, is not overall uniformly a great district. Within the last six years, some schools did not meet the State of Ca or Federal requirements for improvement and are being pre-emptively changed – Chipman Middle School is one of them. At the same time this is/was happening, a large contingent of Section 8 housing was razed and reconstructed into something ‘new’ and new, new homes were put in what would be Chipman territory. The new new homes got a new new school called Ruby Bridges. Interestingly, as the ambiance of poverty shifted, so to did the test scores…..not anything really noteable – in fact, no one that I know of has mentioned it as anything more than a Michelle Rhees (over hyped score improver in DC) anomoly (there is no data so to speak, just a perceived feeling things have changed a bit in Alameda)."

1991,"I had never grown potatoes before. I had never seen a potato plant. I knew that they grew underground and are delicious when pulverized and mixed with a fair amount of cream and butter (Mashed Potatoes), and that’s about it. I assumed, like nearly every other plant, you just chucked a seed into a hole, and boom… potatoes. So, when we went to pick out our seeds for our first garden, I was completely surprised when the associate at the garden center handed me… a bag of potatoes…"
1992,"Loathsome Creek, from which the area gets its name, flows the entire length of the vicinity and is spiritually captivating. It runs directly out of the mountain tops, down through the middle of this vivacious landscape and eventually into the brilliance known as the Hillbillyite River. The beauty of the crisp, clear, refreshing water is enticing to the eyes. The folks that live here know the spiritually healing powers of the water can cure what ails the soul. However, Loathsome Creek can sometimes be misleading. Contrary to the fragrance of the trees and the wildflowers in the woods, the creek can be at the opposite end of the odor spectrum. The water seems inviting, and it appears to be the perfect place to take a dip. Nevertheless, during a dry spell, the stench which emits from the creek is nothing anyone would consider tempting. It’s nothing anyone would choose to experience."
1993,"In many ways this trip completely and forever killed the fun and adventure of cross country road trips, at least for Di and me. We tried one after my return from Afghanistan but after only half of Iowa behind us, Di lost it about all the corn. I knew the cause, and regretted the loss of the Road Trip Adventure."
1994,"My own interest in beer containers admittedly is offbeat and selective, based less on scientific principle and technology and more on the attitude of the individual beer drinker, a state that reflects subconscious preferences, community psychologies and personal superstitions, all these combined into as many different forms as there are human beings to contrive and perpetuate them."

1998,"But P, who as I've mentioned sat to C's left, began noticing things. He noticed that C was pressing his hand, not against the left side of his head, but against his left ear, as if he were trying to block out sound from that side. We also noticed that C often seemed distressed at meals, and that he would make angry grunting noises (which is something he does when stressed). It didn't take long to connect the dots and figure out that C was trying to block out the sound of P's chewing, either by covering that ear or, if/when that didn't work, by making other sounds himself to mask the chewing sounds."

2008,"If you could trade places with anyone, living or dead, for one day...who would it be? Most of us have probably heard that question at one time and have given it some thought. I never knew how to answer it until I had Sam. Now there's no doubt in my mind that it would be my little 3 year old daughter that I would trade places with. I know her better than anyone else does, but in many ways she's a mystery to me. I would love to see how things work in her brain....what she thinks, what she understands, what the world looks like through her eyes. I know that you never know exactly what the experience of another human being is, but with my older 2 kids I feel like I have more to go on...they react to the world similar to the way that I do, and they can tell me about their feelings and experiences. I feel that if I understood more about the ways in which Sam's brain works that I could be a much better parent to her....I could understand more about what she needs and what would help her to learn."

It’s f’ing paradise hear. PARADISE!!!’ ."

The plate is concaved in the center and it was enough that I peeled off the stamp from the wood piece and then stamped (carefully). I now need to fire the plates and then I will move on to painting the leaves. In case you're wondering, I used porcelain paint on the stamp, not ink."
2030,"I got into the venue at 10am and chatted up some of the other volunteers waiting to check in. The other volunteers I spoke to were from CT, RI, NY and MA - a much more diverse crowd than the people I spoke to actually attending the festival. There were college-aged kids, older men and younger women. Many of them just felt that helping out would be a good thing to do and enjoyed the perks of being able to try beer during break. Others were much more serious and planning on opening breweries or becoming head brewers and had come to the festival to scope out the competition. I fell somewhere in between those two extremes."

2078,"I’ll admit that I did get a bit lost in the modern critical approaches chapter. It was interesting that as time as passed, critics have come to rate Emily above Charlotte in their reviews. Charlotte is much beloved by feminist critics, and there has been an increase in interest in Anne. Contemporary critics hardly reviewed Anne’s novels, which is a shame as I would rate Anne’s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall right up there with Charlotte’s Jane Eyre and Emily’s Wuthering Heights. It’s also interesting that contemporary critics of Charlotte Bronte said this of Jane Eyre, “ the plot is most extravagantly improbable.” I disagree. While there are some fantastical elements of the plot, so much of it is based on Charlotte’s real world experiences growing up that it has a deep sense of truth to it."

2080,"“God is Love,” and He has manifested Himself to us by sending “His only Son into the world, so that we might live through Him” (1 John 4:9, 16). By the ministry of the Gospel, “He has given us of His Spirit,” so that we also believe and confess “that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.” In this way we “abide in Him and He in us,” and we “love one another” (1 John 4:2, 7, 13). Such divine love is exemplified in Philip’s preaching of “the good news about Jesus” to the Ethiopian eunuch. And when “they came to some water,” the eunuch was baptized into the very Gospel that Philip had preached (Acts 8:35–38). That Ethiopian was thereby grafted into “the true Vine,” Jesus Christ (John 15:1), just as we are. Already we are clean because of the Word that Christ has spoken to us and by the washing of water with His Word. We now abide in Him by faith in His forgiveness. As He abides in us, both body and soul, with His own Body and His Blood, He “bears much fruit” in us (John 15:3–5)."

2083,"There is no such thing as objective reality. Two cannot be proven. Nothing can be shown to exist. Time and space, love and hate, good and evil, cause and effect, are all just ideas. Anyone who says they know anything is really saying they don’t know the only thing. The greatest religious and philosophical thoughts and ideas in the history of man contain no more truth than the bleating of sheep. The greatest books are no more authoritative than the greatest luncheon meats."
2084,"CL. Much of my own work has involved the use of archive materials, either using the materials themselves such as oral history recordings or to learn about the details of something that I’m also researching through sound. I personally like the way that the small details that are often represented in archives can in some way cross time and enable you to relate to the past in quite a ‘real’ way – much more than the kind of broad sweeps of history that you might get in a book. I also like the different characters of the archives themselves. But I also think that archives generally offer the opportunity to challenge “dominant” readings of history – the Her Noise archive does this – other people’s interpretations. A good example of this in sound is Milo Taylor’s ImmApp project which offers new readings of sound arts histories by interrogating its documents in different ways from the sort of criteria that have led to early establishment of the sound art canons of who is important. I think the important thing with archives is that they need to be kept alive used, re-used and maybe abused and reframed in the lens of the present."

If the gas stations were out of order, and no refineries able to produce more fuel, can you imagine how quickly our “civilized society” would break down? With that event alone, grocery store shelves become empty within a matter of days and farmers can't transport any goods. If you were not aware, grocery stores do not stock much extra produce or food “in the back of the store.” In order to maintain a high profit margin, stores maintain only a few days worth of staples until another shipment arrives. This not only conserves space, but allows for them to keep their overhead lower, among other things."

I love the weird tension of self-consciousness and self-display seen in old snapshots and cheap studio portraits, but I was keen to avoid any kind of sepia-toned, slavish recreations. It was more about taking the mood and atmosphere of these anonymous shots and mixing it up with some David Hockney dandyism/Nancy Cunard decadent glamour/gender mix-up playfulness."

Sure enough, once he was inside, he started burping and farting like crazy, and then they tell him to lay down on some perfectly clean white sheets (which had to be a serious bitch to keep clean, as the cabin was in Buttfuck, Maine, without a washing machine in sight), and he starts bleeding from his ass like a hole-stretched, aged poofter, and leaves a trail of it on the floor as he goes to the shitter.

Jonah prays to the Lord, and the fish vomits him out on dry ground. Jonah prophesies the downfall of Nineveh. The people repent and the city is saved.

So I thought, “what if I could get nature to do this job for me?” I looked over to my tall, robust stand of sunchokes with pole beans twining up them. It seemed like a natural next step to use all three plants together."
2233,"The extreme ease of becoming rich also comes to the aid of upholding morality; money is never an essential consideration in marriages; commerce, industry, the practice of a profession, assure young people of a living and a future. They marry the first woman they fall in love with; and nothing is rarer in the United States than a bachelor of twenty-five. Society thereby gains more married men in place of licentious bachelors. Finally , the condition of equality protects marriages, while difference in rank obstructs them in our country. In the United States there is only one class; no barrier of social distinction separates the young man and young girl who agree to become united. This equality, propitious to legitimate unions, is highly embarrassing to those which are not. The seducer of a young girl necessarily becomes her husband, whatever the difference in their economic position, because while superiority of fortune exists, there is no difference at all in rank. The rectitude of tradition, which applies less to individuals than to society as a whole, gives a serious cast to all American society."

He’s unpredictable -- when I thought I had Polke pinned, I encountered his lush landscapes, his skies of dappled color. Beauty. It was there all along, and Polke wasn’t afraid of it. I find Polke at the heart of a world that I still struggle to understand, the spiritual and earthy store of German art, a zany place that produces some of the best artwork in the world."

I designed this last night using Cricut Craft Room and cut it with my Imagine today Every since I got this cartridge I have been wanting to make this door hanger as I thought my son would love it! He is so into his superhero characters already (he's 2 1/2)! He loves to dress up as Spiderman or Superman and would wear the costumes every day if he could. I know he is going to love it when he wakes up from his nap shortly. My first design had the ""Heroes Only"" logo on it but I thought it was a little plain and he can't read anyway:-). I thought he would like it much better with the Superman logo and his name."

I had a healthy zucchini crop this summer (only three plants) with plenty of blossoms available during the really hot spells. Schreiber's book notes that ""squash flowers can be stuffed with cheeses and other fillings, battered and deep fried or sauteed and added to pasta"". The trick with the squash flowers is to get the male flowers (the ones without a bulbous base that indicates that a baby zucchini is on the way) when they have just started to open, as they are rather fragile and get raggedy even after a day in the sunshine. The other trick is to avoid getting stung by a bee while picking them, as they are also very attractive to the Insect Kingdom.

Unfortunately I don't live in DC or in Virginia, I live in Delaware. My commute to DC was already two and a half hours one way, and I'm supposed to add another hour onto that. Is he kidding?

2387,"On Sunday I have to meet friends for traditional Dennys hangover breakfast at around 8 then take a two-hour trip back home to relieve the babysitter who happens to be my husbands ex-wife (looooong involved story there that resulted in several arguments). Unfortunately I also have 8 articles to write on Sunday, I just hope I have enough brain power to handle them."
2388,"This is very basic. The concern with most professionals at work nowadays is they take their break more than what they are allowed to. For example, they know that there is only one unpaid 1-hour meal break and two 15-minute miscellaneous breaks (depending on what industry you work in or the culture or practice/s the company got used to or promotes to its employees) but they take a break every now and then. Think about it. What they could have done or accomplished during the time that they were still supposed to be working or serving the company was/were wasted in spending time with unnecessary breaks frequently. I know, at this point, you may want to ask me. “So, are you saying that we are not allowed to leave our work station in special cases in which we have to wash our face or smoke our lungs out to shake sleepiness away or maybe to take it easy for some moments just to breathe in fresh air to socialize at work? Or, to have a temporary escape from all the pressure of work?"

2393,"I have a broad interest in what I consider literature for the masses — story papers, magazines, paperback originals. For years these areas were like a newly discovered country with only a handful of us traipsing around wondering what we would find. Twenty or so years ago, there was a growth in academic interest in what was dubbed ""trash aesthetics"". I was rather pleased to see that my books and articles were often cited, not because I had a desire to see my name in print (I've seen it so often it doesn't fill me with quite so much excitement these days) but because it means someone has read something I've written and found something of interest in it."
2394,"18.) “And maybe what she said, which makes her particularly credible, is, ‘These guys didn’t ejaculate on or inside of my body,’ which means she deserves extra credibility because no one’s suggesting that she lied about whether there would be DNA found on her person.”"

I have made the heavens, I have stretched out the two horizons like a curtain, and I have placed the soul of the gods within them. I am he who, if he openeth his eyes, doth make the light, and, if he closeth them, darkness cometh into being. At his command the Nile riseth, and the gods know not his name. I have made the hours, I have created the days, I bring forward the festivals of the year, I create the Nile-flood. I make the fire of life, and I provide food in the houses. I am KhepeRA in the morning, I am RA at noon, and I am Tmu at evening.”"
2413,"Also, do not go to an outlet store for your first pair of shoes or if you are changing brands like I did. Another hard lesson that I pass on to you: an outlet store is an outlet store. It is not a running store. I assumed the outlet store right next to New Balance corporate headquarters would be staffed by runners who knew about running shoes. Au Contraire, these stores are staffed by sales people who may know nothing about running or running shoes."

However if you were to visit your friend on a day to have them act like a huge asshole to you only to apologise later saying ‘I am really sorry, I just haven’t had a hit of morphine for a few days and I feel like shit,’ you are probably not going to forget about it and act as if nothing ever happened."

2421,"Chocolate...the name itself makes my mouth water....well I just had one! :) I love chocolate a lot and keep it in stock at home and munch on it mostly after dinner. My son also loves it a lot, so I cannot say no to him as I like to eat it as much he does. So I decided to keep it healthy and started to prefer and choose dark chocolate. Now I love it more than the regular chocolate, as it has the right amount of sweetness to it, while the regular chocolate makes me think it's too sweet, eventually which is good for me that I think so. :)"

2423,"This was an emotional, oft-times gut wrenching read that once or twice sucked the breath right out of me. The characters were flawed, yes, but so well and humanly drawn. I loved Nicholas, the whirlwind, the charismatic performer who drew all into his orbit, but it was Brandon,the white knight, the damaged boy, who took up residence in my heart and soul."

2425,"Authors have to remember that although Egmont is an editorially-led publishing house, the editors still have to attend an acquisitions meeting where he or she will have to convince the sales, marketing and finance teams to buy the book. These departments would think about whether the book could become a bestseller or be a prize winner. An important thing to market your book well is a good hook. You need to find a one-line bullet point to describe your book (e.g. the ‘xxx meets xxx’ scenario)."
2426,"Unless of course, one counts the religion of secular worship of one man - Kim Jong-un, who had spent time receiving an education in, of all places Switzerland (Reuters) - He was sent there as a child of undetermined age, and spend 8 years there before going back to the underground world of North Korea exposed to the tutelage of his family."

2428,"Here it came. After bumbling away for what seemed like a lifetime, the doctor was finally getting to the point. Was Martha ready? Cynthia had said it was like taking bullet to the chest, being told you had cancer. There was no way to avoid the obvious cliché that you were probably going to die and, even if you didn’t, you had probably come closer than most. It certainly provided reflection on mortality at any rate."
2429,"Overall, I am quite disappointed with the Roses Ultimes de Chanel Collection. While most of the shades are lovely, I don't think I was particularly blown away by any of the items. Chanel has released many unique, fashion-forward les vernis in previous collections and these just don't seem to be on the same level. I think most of the nail polish shades are dupable from other lines for a lower price point. At $26USD a bottle, I was expecting a lot more. As for the glossimers, Jalousie is the most opaque out of the 6."

2436,"We have all heard the tired old lie that the average serial killer is a white male, it is repeated time and again in newspaper and magazines, on crime shows and in TV dramas, and everyone believes it, however, the problem is it is just not true. Male, he may be, but white, not so much."
2437,"‘I did feel honoured because I’m a foreigner and I was living in England and I was offered the chance to be an A-lister,’ she insists. ‘Normally I spend a lot of my time solitaire. It just felt a bit weird, because I have to be able to write music, and when I walk down the street I have this music going on in my head. That’s my life, and it felt like a thousand people had moved in there and they were leaving their dirty socks around, so I couldn’t write music. I’m a pretty tough cookie you know, and if I could endure that and still write good music, I would have endured it; but it wasn’t creative, so it had absolutely no interest for me. It was boring.’"

2441,"All the teachers we had are either retired or dead, but Jack and I did see one of of our classmates, Patty Drake Wheeler, who is now a teacher there. The building, though, really hasn’t changed much and it was comforting to see it exactly the same way as I remembered it when I went here from grades 3 to 6. The tin ceilings, the century old oak flooring, and the tiny gym are like a time capsule."
2442,"Now who can top that?? I’m green with envy. Where was I? Oh, yeah, green. So this episode summary mentions that Magnum sets down a John D MacDonald novel to make a phone call, and he includes a still from the show showing the book sitting on the nightstand (open! jeez, doesn’t Magnum know this will crease the spine?). I was able to identify the book from seeing only a part of the spine and a fraction of the cover. See? This kind of stuff could make you famous, too!"

2449,"Jessica's mom, a source of much folklore in our circle, is Korean, and so since my formative college days, Jessica has been responsible for initiating me into the world of Korean food. It started with packages her mom would send her: giant 70s orange tubs of brown, swampy fermented bean paste inhabited our fridge. At odd hours, Jessica would heat dried fish -- small whole fish pounded flat and dried like jerky -- directly on the stove's burners. The pungent reek would take over the apartment. It got better though -- Jess also introduced us to delicious sheets of crisp toasted seaweed, and smushy little Korean mochi with a bit of sweet bean paste in the middle. Later came all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue, fancy Korean coffee shops, and short rib soup you eat with scissors."
2450,"I have continued to volunteer for the Australian Breastfeeding Association this year. My main role this year has been that of co-group leader. I took myself off email and phone counselling halfway through this year so that I could focus on parenting my little baby. Actually, the day that Gideon was born was meant to be my last helpline shift! I had him about 45 minutes before my shift was due to start. Chris couldn't work out how to log me off so the phone kept ringing for ages until he figured it out!"

2463,"Van Til was deeply suspicious of Barth’s simple declarations that the Bible is the Word of God, and he interpreted Barth’s is as merely becoming and not as being. He believed that Barth failed to leave behind neo-Kantian presuppositions and German idealism, abandoning realism and a correlation between scripture and the Word of God. Van Til, however, properly understood Barth’s objection that orthodoxy had objectified scripture and the Word of God, leaving the human as the subject to dominate the Object, but did Van Til read into Barth a too settled distinction between scripture and the Word of God, allowing being to be interpreted only through the lens of becoming."

2465,"That was a long and horrible night as I drifted through pain and in-and-out of a drug-induced state of semi-sleep. The only bright part of the whole night was when, around 3am, the baby really started kicking me, as if to say ""I'm ok in here, Mom! I made it"". I smiled and put my hand on my belly, content and happy to know that I would still be feeling those kicks for many weeks to come."

I always said I wanted to do this distance again and 2012 looks like it will be my year! I am eyeing the Key City Bank Marathon in Burlington,VT. I absolutely love that city and I ran once there with a friend for 2 hours and didn't even realize how far we went because it was just a gorgeous place to run. The downtown area, bike path and Lake Champlain make for me a perfect running spot."

2491,"A 2% lager is on permanent offer however, and it’s the basics and value range in any given supermarket. What glass to neck it from? There is no branded Sainsbury’s basic’s glass as far as I know. I decide to phone ‘em and ask and got a number here. “I am a beer enthusiast and my favourite beer is Sainsbury’s basics lager, is there a branded glass available with which to drink it that I could have? I’ll happily buy one” fair play to the girl on the other end “Are you having a laugh, is this a wind up?” “Yeh, sorry love” A compromise is in order.

2493,"And a second entry for ""the good"": last night's dinner. How many of you were readers of the late, lamented Gourmet Magazine? My guess is most of you. It kills me that when I sold my house in 2008 to move in with my now-husband, I recycled almost a hundred issues of Gourmet because I didn't want to move them. I figured that there were plenty more issues to come, right? A year later Gourmet stopped publication."

With a few Christian friends leaving the area for various reasons, I've been wondering how I'm going to manage. God, ever-faithful, has reminded me of a time a few short years ago when I felt the same way. Just the fact that here I am again shows that He did provide for me, which is comforting to know that He can do it again."
2497,"The movie is still a product of its time. Between Bobby’s ‘golly gee’s’ and the notable lack of locked doors (even at night), The Day the Earth Stood Still almost demands parody. But you can’t laugh at it without feeling a little bitter. If we question Helen’s choice to let Rennie’s ‘Mr. Carpenter’ watch Bobby for the day, despite having only just met him, isn’t it because we’d feel unsafe doing that today? And, had we the option of living in a world where ‘child molester’ wasn’t a default assumption, wouldn’t we choose it, assuming our trust was justified? No one would rather live in the 1950s than today—except, maybe a few white males—but it wasn’t hell for everyone who had to. Not in this film, anyway."

2501,"I choose a zig zag route through jostling groups; last minute toilet dashers and most dangerous of all hazards: the random wavy arms. Like flailing beer assassins, they can spell disaster. Unlike stationary hazards such as random laptop cases this foe often cannot be anticipated with forethought. They require the lightening dexterity of a young Jackie Chan. In my case a quick back step and roll passed this obstacle with zero spillage. Other moves for any aspiring Master are the shoulder nudge, beer in the air (a risky move when failure leads to spillage on heads below. In which case normal Kung Fu maybe required); all accompanied by a booming shout of 'SCUSE ME!

Of course you can add the usual favorites – olives, corn, Bulgarian cheese, mushrooms, etc."
2524,"If things aren't going well though, my best advice would be to narrow the question. Broader questions are usually more complex. I started conservation of mass with, ""What happens to atoms in a chemical reaction?"" (Actually, the question was about why ice melts when you heat it but paper burns) and kids were flying all over the place. They generated their own claim and designed their own experiments and it was a disaster. There was no real way to differentiate through experiment most of their claims (atoms are being fused together, atoms are exploding, atoms turn into heat). I rebooted with whether atoms are destroyed or not in a chemical reaction and it worked much better. We all did a similar experiment and students were able to make a well-reasoned argument that atoms weren't destroyed."

Schiff immigrated to America in 1865. He joined forces with Abraham Kuhn and married Solomon Loeb’s daughter. Loeb and Kuhn married each others sisters and the Kuhn Loeb dynasty was consummated. Felix Warburg married Jacob Schiff’s daughter. Two Goldman daughters married two sons of the Sachs family, creating Goldman Sachs. In 1806 Nathan Rothschild married the oldest daughter of Levi Barent Cohen, a leading financier in London. The Cohen family was now part of the club."

I read a nice if perhaps slightly-uninformed piece by Film Crit Hulk on why Weezer sucked after Matt left. Short answer Hulk give is no harmony. The music is much lamer without his contribution. Of course Hulk really mean no counterpoint from bass. Less structure. Less interesting. Less tension too apparently."

In 1650 there were about 270 stave churches left, and in the next century 136 of these were lost. Today there are only 28 stave churches in Norway.

2601,"Well this last month has been as good to me as the one before it. I got three of my published books put on kindle through their Kindle Direct Publishing website. Between the three books I’ve had about 1500 hits. These are not actual sales though; it’s more like checking it out from the library. But I think I’m supposed to get a cut of a $600, 000 dollar pot, which worked out to be about $2.00 a hit last month. So if this is correct, maybe I’ll actually get a little something for all the work I’ve been doing for nothing all these years. But God has been good and we’ve been blessed many times over, even with no consistent money coming in. I’d find furniture on the side of the road, been blessed with kid’s clothes by many Christian friends, been blessed myself with clothes when the lady I used to care for died. We’d get unexpected money from somewhere every time there was a need. This month I was really struggling to have money for paying the water bill. The lady that runs the dollar general store suggested I come out there and sit one day with my books and I had almost forgotten about it. But one morning I woke up and felt God saying to go and do it. I opened my Bible and read a few chapters and wound up reading the passage where it says, “Go and sell what you have” so I did. That day I gathered up about 20 of my Christian books off my shelf and brought some of my own. I sold all of mine and several more besides. Then a couple of weeks later, the day before my water was to be cut off, I went back. This time I gathered up about 200 Christian books and a few of my own. Before we left for the day, we had sold all but about 30 of the books and had more than enough to pay the water bill, buy a few groceries, and order some more books for my ministry."

Luckily, the positives of smelling wind, seeing red wing black birds, hawks and the occasional deer make it worth while.

I’m sure some allergic reaction lawsuit cost them millions of dollars and now they have to be extra careful, but when I ordered my bowl of lettuce from them, I wasn’t expecting the Spanish Inquisition. I would like to think they put as much effort into making my food dairy free as everyone else, but I guess there are levels of dairy free, and I only fall under the personal choice category."

Bring your hand down near your dog’s neck–if you have a small dog you will have to bend over. Quickly jerk the leash to the side (NOT back), and then immediately let the leash loose again. The leash should be taunt for less than 2 seconds."

Remember to keep an open mind when reading online reviews – results are subjective and many patients have a difficult time seeing their own brilliant results for quite awhile after surgery. Check out photos and make a decision for yourself. There is a large and helpful community online so ask questions, make friends, and supplement your research with the information you find online. Many times facial feminization patients take a great deal of pride in their recent procedure and many produce good quality YouTube videos regarding the plastic surgeon that they used. Do a search for your plastic surgeon’s name in YouTube and the search engines and see if any videos come up."

2678,"When I hear a title like Hell Comes to Frogtown (1987) a little twinge of excitement tickles my spine. I watched this movie knowing it was going to be bad. It did not disappoint. Hell Comes to Frogtown stars wrestler “Rowdy” Roddy Piper (They Live) as Sam Hell, one of the last remaining fertile males in the not too distant future. Hell is captured and his netherbits are locked up by the provisional government so that he can go on a mission—wait for it, wait for it—to impregnate all the fertile females that are held hostage in Frogtown. So what is Frogtown? Frogtown is the steam-filled factory-like settlement inhabited by mutant frog people. Ribbit. If this movie sounds a little campy and chauvinistic, it’s only because it is. This movie can’t go ten minutes without women disrobing themselves. Frogtown has everything you’d expect from a campy eighties sci-fi action comedy. You got your butch, cigar-chomping, short-hair chick who’s always stroking a big gun (Cec Verrell). Then there’s the “nerdy” chick with the stick up her butt who lets her hair down and removes her gigantic owl glasses (and several articles of clothing) to reveal she’s secretly super hot (Sandahl Bergman). There’s your regular Joe protagonist (Piper) who just wants to get the blasted electrocution diaper off his junk. Finally there are some truly silly people in big frog puppet suits. The film is ugly and terrible…just the way I like it sometimes. If nothing else, it’s better than Super Mario Bros."

Social media networks are already under intensive federal scrutiny. This year, it is ostensibly to track down undefined terrorist threats. But social media, so popular today, must be understood as a two-edged sword. The same social media that facilitated the Arab Spring, today brings the secret police of Syria, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and other nations to the doors of obscure bloggers hidden in tiny apartments, to drag them away to secret torture cells."

This is not conditional on how much we do for Him, but purely based on what He did for us in Christ dying for our sins. It is not based on how much or how often you read the Bible, but rather what the Bible says. That’s right, God’s promise doesn’t change or is not withdrawn just because we are slackers in reading it. Just remember that when we read it, we learn of God’s love for us and see how awesome He is."

There were several speakers – student speaker’s from the bachelor’s programs and master’s programs provided some inspiring words and the VP of UOP southeastern region provided some additional insightful advice. The most colorful speaker was Simon Bailey, who is a motivational speaker and that he was! He spoke at length about releasing your brilliance and it was quite motivating. I laughed many times throughout his speech and he left me wanting to do more with my life. My daughter said he had a funny laugh and she was laughing because he was laughing! lol! He’s written several books and speaks throughout the country.

For all we know we’re spreading the disease faster by burning them. The living death they are calling it, a wasting disease that rots you from the inside out. Your organs shut down, your muscles atropine, and your body dies, but your mind, your mind continues to function locking you in the unending agony and mental anguish of death. They say its the only humane way to end their suffering, but I think we’ve lost our humanity. I witnessed one of the burnings, a young woman about nineteen or twenty, withering in agony silently screaming as the flames ate away her flesh. I couldn’t bear it, I still can’t. Even now when I close my eyes I see her face contorted in pain. It took the medical profession months to realize what was happening. I tried to warn them, so we could contain it before it got out of control, no one listened. Now they’ve shut down the hospitals, abandoning people to suffer whether they have the disease or not. The epidemic has reached Europe now, Governments have started closing its boarders. People are hiding in their homes afraid to venture out."

2746,"I laughed out loud when Sonia Yaco said “archivists do not have broad or deep habits of collaboration” (p.3). While our curmudgeon ways are stereotypical, I also think that is debatable. I agree, workflow is definitely key and letting catalogers or metadata specialists in on the process is extremely successful. You can not only apply authority language in the scope and content notes, but Archivist’s Toolkit allows for controlled subject headings attached to the record, but then later when the finding aid is mounted on the web, the job is easier to add notes or other genre fields. AT also generates EAD. I do not have much to do with the process of encoding *yet*, with a on-site supportive IT department, it is a breeze, but I find that everyone involved in the processing should have some knowledge of EAD. As far as I’m concerned, taking institutional knowledge, including compliance procedures with you, when you retire is extremely detrimental."

I’ve managed to receive permission to film at a Christchurch gig venue that started up after the earthquakes demolished most of the city. It’s an awesome intimate space that my friend Rachael plays at frequently (Rachael just happens to play the singer in my film that plays at the gig venue… what are the chances ;P ) but this shoot will (hopefully) involve about 80 extras! Why so many? Well, yet again I’ve decided to be super stupid and shoot one of the scenes at the gig venue as a single shot – a single shot that travels around the entire space… requiring a room full of extras! My fingers are cross, ever so tightly, that enough people turn up for the shoot – otherwise will have to rethink the awesome plan for the shot."

2750,"I travelled up by train on Friday evening. There were only four carriages and it was standing room only all the way; it was also very, very warm. Problems on the west coast line meant that the train was even more busy than normal. The conductor kept apologising for the cramped conditions, her tone increasingly desperate as more squeezed in at every stop. Eventually I made it to Preston and checked in to my hotel. A meal, couple of glasses of wine, and a decent night’s sleep sorted me out."
2751,"Since I slept in until about 9:00 I decided this would be a great morning to make some scones. They only take about 40 minutes total to make which is just enough time to sip some coffee. They’re about as difficult to make as pancakes, which isn’t too tough. I used my homemade strawberry jam in them because the recipe uses a cup of diced strawberries which is exactly what was in that jam. How handy. The first time I made this strawberry scone recipe a few weeks ago I was trying to impress the previously mentioned boyfriend with my domestic skills. I didn’t separate the individual scones on the baking sheet and they did not cook in the centers. I was mortified. He said it tasted like cookie dough and ate it anyway. Twice since then I’ve made them just to prove to myself that I could. This scone practice is fine with my son. He has eaten more scones from coffee shops around the country than most adults have. I was about to make a glaze to put on the top but there was no powdered sugar in the cabinet so I made honey butter instead. Later in the day I texted the boyfriend to tell him I had not messed up this batch. He was sad to have missed them."

We were cruising along pretty good, when we happened upon a body in full camo fatigues lying on the ground on the side of the trail. I actually said ""whoa"" really loud, and then went back to him. He at first appeared dead, but then he moved and put his finger to his mouth like he was saying ""shhh."" He then said, ""I'm OK"" and we resumed running."

A convenience store chain, Kum & Go, purchased a similar system from March Networks and described their experience with it in a whitepaper the company released. For a gas station, when someone fills up their tank but then drives off without paying, it’s a problem. But it could also be a managerial issue, too. How can you be sure that the person working the register didn’t take the money and then just say that a car drove off? According to Kum & Go, their surveillance system now allows them to see that latter process in action. “Well see the clerk pocket the money and hit the drive-off key,” a Kum & Go manager said. “We always knew this happened, but we could never prove it.”"

Located at the epicenter of New York City's recent development boom, the neighborhood saw countless industrial buildings and row houses torn down by developers. In their place, dozens of luxury condominium towers were constructed, permanently altering the skyline. By July 2009, however, ""The Billyburg Bust"" was reported by New York Magazine, which wrote that the area was ""littered with half-built shells of a vanished boom.""

Almost everytime he gets a cold he gets dry, non-productive coughs especially at night. Sometimes the night time coughing is the first cold symptom and even a couple of time he has coughing fits at night but the next day he is perfectly fine...no cough, no runny nose, no sneezing. So I was concerned that asthma could be in the future and wondered how Tyler's health would be over the winter."

I didn’t go to a high school like that in Australia so that dynamic was new to me. We all really had fun together and it made the summer we filmed that fun,” she says. Though her character was naïve, Olivia was determined she wouldn’t be a complete wimp and kept trying to inject some backbone into her. As her co-star, Travolta backed her all the way. They became fast friends and she remembers he would look out for her. “During one of the scenes at the drive in, he messed up his lines on purpose so they would do another take and he said ‘you can do better’ – he was very caring to make sure everything I did was the best.” The ‘Grease’ soundtrack, on which they sing together, remains a crowd pleaser with remixes like the Grease medley still a staple in nightclubs."

2903,"Sometimes musicians email me. Emails are important if you want people to listen to your music. I don’t want to scare bands into not emailing me because honestly, I enjoy getting new music delivered into my inbox, howeverrrrr… Occasionally, I get some really bad emails. I realise it’s not an easy thing and I’m by no means saying I won’t listen to a band who doesn’t have a PR company emailing some really professional stuff out for them because to be honest, it’s nicer getting emails from the bands themselves as opposed to someone in a PR office. ANYWAY here’s a little guide that’ll hopefully help you on the road to writing a nice email to send to people."
2904,"I really wanted to give the quilter the ability to use their stash but also allow them to go shopping. Who wouldn't want to have some of the newest cutest fabrics in their scrap quilt? It was VERY HARD for me to STOP buying fabric. I kept telling myself, “Ooooh! Wouldnʼt this be cute? I have to have a bit of this!” I actually used over 150+ fabrics in this quilt. I hope you have fun playing with your stash and adding the newest cutest fabrics to your quilt."

2909,"Garbo fans will be shocked by her look in Gösta Berling. She’s much heavier and her hair is a brunette bird’s nest. But the face is the same, and it’s notable that, despite MGM’s celebrated makeover, the studio taught her nothing new about acting. When she falls in love with Gösta, we know it, as we always do when Garbo’s called upon to show us her desire. It is unmistakable and, if this film is any indication, it was innate."
2910,"This morning when my Husband and I checked Cozi (my favorite app), we noticed that we had a day off! There was no t-ball game to rush off to, no doctor’s appointments for anyone, you get the idea. What is one to do with a full day off?"

2913,"Despite all of this, we were still able to be taken aback by all the beauty around us. We have been there before a couple of times, but it never grows old, it never looks dull. It was cold and foggy and but I really don’t think that there are many places that still look so lovely on a grey day like this. Even the tip of the tower was hiding under a cloud of fog. It had something magical to it."

I felt overwhelmed with all the character development of the individual members of the village and wondered if I would be required to learn this all over again in a second book. The main feeling I had was “get on with it”. It seemed slow, even for a cozy. I also wondered if Max would have been able to solve the case if it had not been for the last-minute witness turning up. The conclusion was not worthy of the writing."

2924,"This “subjection” is not “willingly,” i.e. creation made no sinful decision that caused this to happen. Thus, in a certain sense, creation is not “fallen.” However, it is subject to the same “fallen” existence that we know. Were fallen human beings to live in an unfallen world, our catastrophe would be greater (perhaps unredeemable). Little wonder, however, that creation groans. That it tolerates our footsteps is a sign of great patience and love."
2925,"Think. Quiet time is time well-spent. Jack asked good questions and took this time to think through good answers. He also knew that some questions would not be answered in this life, but that contemplation has value anyway."
2926,"Not that it would have helped Adamson, who cast his then-wife Regina as our heroine of the piece, when in fact the only thing she had going for her was large hair, large eyelashes and big heaving...talents. Once a showgirl, always a showgirl, and the only talent Carroll had here was her blank stare, which she employs here more than once. She perfected it in other films like Satan's Sadists, Brain of Blood and Blazing Stewardesses too, but also appeared in The Glass Bottom Boat, The Slender Thread and Viva Las Vegas. Hey, at least she was in films more people heard of than they did Satan's Sadists."

2935,"When the the Highborne were exiled, they eventually settled in the Eastern Kingdoms, in an area now known as Tirisfal Glades in the then-Human kingdom of Lordaeron. They settled there because they could sense the magic of the place, something the Highborne needed to feed their magical addiction since the destruction of their former source, the Well of Eternity. Soon after settling in Tirisfal, some of the Highborne slowly began to go mad, and those who yet retained their sanity realized the source of the Glade’s magical power was something truly evil. It is thought this evil magic is due to the presence of an Old God, imprisoned deep beneath Tirisfal."

I worry about my family and about my friends. I worry about getting assignments done well and on time; as soon as I’ve handed them in, I worry about getting my grade back. By the time that happens, I’m busy worrying about something else. I worry about my vocation, about finding God’s will in my life, about doing the right thing at all times."

2955,"I keep thinking about how awesome next Christmas will be. Last Christmas was the best one in years- before that one, we'd given up all hope of a biological child. I remember that Christmas, we'd filled our ""Wish"" ornament with our wishes, and then we told them to each other. Our wishes were the same- that we'd get enough money for adoption, and for a house. While neither of those wishes came true, I wouldn't trade what we have now for the world. Things aren't perfect- far from it- but they're wonderful."

2959,That’s because assaulting peaceful crowds in a public square demanding real democracy – economic and not just political – would remind the world of the brittle autocrats who brutalised their people demanding justice before they were swept away by the Arab Spring. And the state violence has already backfired. After police attacked a Saturday afternoon march that started from Liberty Park the crowds only got bigger and media interest grew.
2960,"American economic reality is something else entirely – rougher going than we like to think, but not an evil thing. Bear in mind that the transparency of our system remains very high compared to most non-capitalist settings, where goods are scarce and the economic infrastructure is all but dysfunctional. The watchdog agency Transparency International’s Global Corruption Barometer always ranks the United Statesamong the very best in its country by country listings. In those countries ranked lower, nepotism, bribery, and under-the-table transactions accompany virtually all basic economic transactions. By contrast, while connections here can help in getting a job, education, merit, and ability also matter."

2962,"A. To find sub-atomic particles, it is necessary to collide other particles together at high energies using a machine such as the £5bn Large Hadron Collider, which accelerates sub-atomic particles called hadrons at 99.9999991 per cent of the speed of light. Sensitive detectors at the sites where the hadrons collide are then designed to monitor the tell-tale signs of a Higgs particle. There are two detectors or experiments trying to find the Higgs, one is called Atlas the other is called CMS and both are searching at similar energy levels. Unfortunately, there is a lot of “noise” coming from other particles and collisions that can mask the existence of the Higgs. Sophisticated statistical analysis is the only way of improving the certainty that a Higgs has truly been detected."

2965,"Sensing, as a minister, should remember how exquisitely tuned Jesus' intuition was. He used it to discern any number of less-than-obvious realities and go straight to the heart of things. His remark to Nathanael -- ""before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you"" -- is one of dozens of instances of Jesus' intuition. It is a faculty to be developed and used, not one to be dismissed by leaving out important aspects of another's experience. Thus, Sensing's comments on what amounts to Jacobsen's ""After Action Report"" are disappointing at best."

2973,"In training the mind through meditation and contemplative disciplines, a helpful analogy is to regard the mind-brain-body as a remarkable musical instrument that is capable of generating the sweetest of music, yet all too often is poorly maintained, left untuned and plagued with chaotic and noisy sounds. If we sincerely wish to learn to play beautiful music, we must study with a master who knows the instrument inside and out. Both teachers and students alike need to know how to quiet their stress, maintain emotional awareness and receptiveness for learning. In order to develop a calm, clear, joyful, and loving mind, we need the guidance of someone who thoroughly understands what the mind is, how the mind works and how it can be transformed … someone whose own heart-mind is truly open to the full depths of being and embraces the full dimension of all creation."

2990,"""Before the words of institution come the actions: the breaking of bread and the offering of wine. The breaking of bread and the passing of the chalice are in the first instance the function of the head of the family, who welcomes the members of his family to his meal; but these are also gestures of hospitality, of welcoming the stranger who is not part of the household to table fellowship and communion. These very gestures, in the meal with which Jesus takes leave of those who are his own, acquire an entirely new depth: He gives a visible sign of welcome to the meal in which God gives Himself. Jesus offers and communicates Himself in the form of bread and wine"""

When I was first learning about the solar system, my dad told me that the sun was a star and as such, can and will eventually explode. It really freaked me out. How can you have faith the sun will rise when it might just go kaboom while you sleep?"
2995,Our intrepid trio are not the only heroes in this story.

So you might recall that about this time last year I had a mini meltdown and sold all of my vintage stuff off in huge collections and virtually gave the rest away and quit the blog and went into a total hermetic state for a few months then came back in October and was talking all this sort of abstract, kind of ungrounded crazy talk, then retreated again until, like, a few weeks ago? Well, that's sort of what it might have looked like from here. And that is sort of what happened actually, but from where I am standing now, peering back over the year, A FEW HUNDRED SHIT TONS OF STUFF WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. I think I actually get the concept of alchemy now."

3051,"Dryers usually use the most energy of any household appliance. Line drying my clothes will reduce energy costs and CO2 emissions. Line drying does require a tiny bit of planning (rain or shine?), but I don’t think it will be too difficult. With any luck we will see a few sunny days during the term."

3055,"Chekhov is known as the master of the short story, and after reading these five stories, it is easy to see why. Each story is exquisitely crafted and nearly flawless. Chekhov writes with such precision, especially when describing the natural world. His words perfectly evoke the scene: a garden in flower; a riverbank; an avenue of trees; a field just before a rainstorm; the sea."
3056,"And a setpiece doesn’t have to cost millions or tens of millions of dollars, either, although as authors, we have the incredible advantage of an unlimited production budget. Did you authors all get that? We have an UNLIMITED PRODUCTION BUDGET. Whatever settings, crowds, mechanical devices, alien attacks or natural disasters we choose to depict, our only budget constraint is in our imaginations. The most powerful directors in Hollywood would KILL for a fraction of our power. Theoretically, they can’t even begin to compete."
3057,"This time last week, I had just come back from a week at The Hurst, the Arvon Foundation's centre in Shropshire. Like the other Arvon centres, it is a lovely house in a beautiful place, peaceful and tranquil, with lots of space to think and write. It was the playwright John Osborne's house, and so has lots of writerly associations and reminders, with playbills up everywhere and loos sponsored by Maggie Smith."

3061,"Problem is, while the future of movies (and TV) at home may damn well be streaming, it certainly won’t be unlimited and it certainly won’t be for a reasonable flat monthly fee. No, the studios want as much blood from the turnip as they can get. So why would they license their content to a service that charges $20 a month for unlimited viewing…when they can license them to services that charge $2.99 a pop? They wouldn’t, and that’s why Netflix Streaming is a virtual wasteland."

That’s right, I follow a British lady because she’s awesome, and she likes eggs. Also, she’s got some pretty great advice on how to cook things. When I read her posts, it’s like a flash back to the 1950′s, and I feel like I’m living in an alternate universe while I make things the way she suggests. (They also tend to work 99% of the time, even if they don’t use crazy appliances or are slightly old fashioned.)"

Then it's just you and the book, heading into the sunset."
3071,"i have to say the girls' performances were just wonderful! so was the work of the school staff.. what really shocked me was the audience.. of course everybody was like 1.5 hours late, this is normal here.. but even when the action on stage started, women were still arriving and behaving as though nothing formal was going on - walking around, talking loudly, laughing and paying little attention to what was going on on the stage.. it all looked more like a dress rehearsal to me than an actual performance day.. this continued even when the principal was giving a speech but she didn't say one word to make them quiet, as if this kind of behavior was normal"

3077,"The goal of this class is to think about what it would look like for the Christian faith to be that shaping, formative story which – explicitly or subconsciously – shapes the foundational ways in which we see the world. And the way we’re going to approach this question is through the writings of two English fantasy writers with a brief discussion of a Victorian journalist enormously admired by both our writers. Late in his life, C.S. Lewis wrote an autobiography of his early life titled Surprised by Joy. In it he described the effect that the fairy tales of George MacDonald had on him: “They baptized my imagination,” he said. Over the next six weeks we’re going to return over and over to that line – what is a baptized imagination? What does it mean for our very imagination, the core of our being, to be itself Christian?"
3078,"The other day a friend of mine said that a fair fight is a fight where there are set rules and both parties abide by those rules, only then is it a fair fight. Fighting against Africans cannot be a fair fight, because they do not abide by the rules, which is why whites cannot win against them, unless they adapt themselves appropriately, which seems unlikely at this stage."
3079,"Still blazing his own path, the indomitable Jon Hewitt (Redball, Acolytes) returns to the big screen with his latest feature X, a gritty erotic thriller set amidst Sydney’s seedy King’s Cross district, where two women plying the world’s oldest trade experience an ugly night that will change their lives forever. After screening at the Melbourne International Film Festival and the Melbourne and Sydney Underground fests, as well as gaining a theatrical, VOD and DVD release in North America via IFC Films, X finally makes its European debut with a Raindance screening on October 6."

But that IPA, Wit, and Brown Ale just seal the deal for me. I couldn't get enough of the stuff. The Brown ale was very chewy, malty, a touch of syrup, and the hops cut it just right. No sense of the 7.6 ABV. The IPA was a great piney thing. Just great while hanging out in the chill. The wit was a perfect citrus flavor with medium body coming from the oats, ranks right up there with some of the better wits I've had. I'm loving it man. Just need these guys to get some handles down here and we are on our way."

3097,"For me, the courage to be different comes in at least three forms. The first form involves being able too see differently about the object of your affection. For me, the primary problem in this area involves around seeing a women as nothing more than a sexual object. When I was six or seven years old, I often admired the girls I was around. While I was initially attracted to a girl’s personality, I almost always was more attracted to her physical features—her breast and ass. Especially her ass. Much like the other boys I was around, I always found a woman’s ass the object of my sexual fantasy. As I got older, my friends and I always measured a girl’s sexual readiness by the circumference of her ass, and the size of the “gap” that we believed existed between her thighs, below her vagina. For us, having sex with a girl was the primary measure of our maturity and our readiness for manhood."
3098,"And the other nice thing about letting go of the lifestyle and just loving GOD and others is that it tends to eliminate the gray areas that we Christians run into. Rather than looking at something and struggling over whether it's right or wrong, black or white, you're faced with this question of if whatever it is you want to do will be loving to GOD and/or loving to others."

3107,"The Darent flows southwards beneath ash, sycamore and alder, their canopies reflected, shimmering, in the faintly rippled surface of the barely moving river; an enormous collapsed field maple lies adjacent to the riverside path, sprawling like a drunkard; songbirds flit from branch to branch; in the clear water, darting shadows hint at the presence of fish. An idyllic scene along a typical lowland chalk stream – but one which a few years ago may have been less vibrant. From being one of the finest trout rivers in the country, the river suffered from pollution and over-abstraction during the 20th century, many stretches running dry during drought years. But over recent years, as a plaque by the path commemorates, the Darent was the subject of a restoration programme – which seems to have been thoroughly successful."

A religion might attempt to codify these strands — as with the Talmud and Judaism, in context of “Footnote” — but the reason re ligious scholarship continues over thousands of years is that no final code is ever really achieved.

When the tenderloin was in the oven I let the girls try a little bit of the rub that was on the tenderloin and they liked it. I made some peas (which I know they love) and gave them a little bit of the pork. They could stop eating it! I had to make them eat their peas just to slow them down. We could have easily eaten the full pound of tenderloin just the four girls and myself.

I honestly don’t know how anybody could read for long periods of time while listening to music, as it’s far too distracting, but when it comes to writing, it’s a different story.

3183,"One person in particular who has been such an inspiration to me is a man named Byran Smith. When I was living in Nashville, I signed up to teach adults to read. Byran was 42. He was from Jamaica. He had a wife and four kids, and he was at a second grade reading level. By the time we were done, he could write checks, read his children bedtime stories and help work colleagues spell words. Working so diligently to try and explain our hard (nonsensical) language was one of the toughest and most rewarding experiences of my life. It’s a constant reminder that without words, we have so little, and with words, our lives can become richer and more beautiful than we could have ever dreamed. I think of him and his perseverance whenever I get tired or don’t feel like doing much. His ambition is an ongoing lesson to never lose mine."
3184,"We continue to see a bull market unfolding in the US stock indices from the Mar09 low at SPX 667. Primary I, of a five primary wave bull market, completed in May11 at SPX 1371. Primary II completed in Oct11 at SPX 1075. Primary III is currently underway. Within Primary III we are tracking five Major waves. Major wave 1 concluded in Oct11 at SPX 1293. Major wave 2 ended in Nov11 at SPX 1159. And, Major wave 3 probably concluded in Apr12 at SPX 1422. We state probably, because the SPX has not confirmed a Major wave 4 downtrend yet. When Major wave 4 does conclude we will still have a rising Major wave 5 ahead to end Primary wave III. Then a declining Primary wave IV will lead to a rising Primary wave V to end the bull market some time in 2013 within the SPX 1545-1586 range. This should be followed by a nasty 50% market decline into 2014/2016."

3191,"Mrs Badger has a bit of history with tombolas. As a child, she was eerily lucky at these thrilling games of chance, with the winning tickets somehow magnetically attracted to her sticky little hands. Tombola organizers would quake at her approach, knowing that she would clear their supply of prizes in one fair swoop, emerging from every roll of the barrel with her arms full of chocolates, perfume, bottles of spirits, and other items entirely suitable for seven-year-old girls."

3197,"What they’ve done is terrible and shouldn’t be done ever again. But I do believe that all of them deserve a second chance. There is no doubt that I am angry with each of them. No one should ever be allowed to beat up another human being, let alone your romantic partner. Nobody should get away with racially abusing someone else, regardless of whether the whole world is watching or not. But we all make mistakes, small or big. Yes, Terry, Suarez and Brown should know that they shouldn’t have done what they have but the damage has been done. I just wish that they have learned from their experiences."

3199,"I contemplated not going in to work. But I did. There were ... I want to say four of us ... who were ""Deadheads"", two of us who had done tour (me and one other). The other one had called out. I think one guy with whom I could commiserate was there that night. Every time we passed one another in the kitchen or at the bar, we'd just keep repeating the same thing over and over, and I don't even remember what it was, but I know it was something like....

3227,"Those are possessed with devils… Many are under demonic oppressions and under demonic control… Satanism is on the rampage in our nation… There are religious demons, lust demons, cruelty demons, fad demons, immoral demons and hundreds more that control the lives of people. Jesus commissioned the believers to “cast out devils”… Job said “I knocked out the fangs of the godless oppressors and made them drop their victims.” (TLB Job 19:17) God set in the church those with the gift of discerning of spirits… and the power to cast them out. Pray for those gifted with this ministry. Casting out devils is not a popular ministry. We are in the days of spiritual warfare… Jesus wants people free."

3231,"I started out from Lincoln and drove west to Lexington, Nebraska. From there, I dropped south on highway 283 to try to get ahead of a developing storm to my west. By ""get ahead"", I mean that I wanted to get to an east-west road option somewhere on the south side of the storm before the storm over ran it. Doing this meant punching rather close to the core of the storm; it was a good three solid minutes of driving through dime and nickel sized hail. When I popped out of the hail, I saw this:"

3236,"The Dutch are the quiet ones of Europe. We don’t get much news of the Dutch as not much happens in Holland. I guess this is because they are all busy during the day unloading all the stuff that arrives in the massive port of Rotterdam and in the evening they are at home probably reading pornography, or going out to sex shows, smoking marijuana or relaxing with their feet up in wooden shoes, smoking a novelty handcrafted pipe.

I thought that a relaxing sojourn apart from Lady McCartney would refresh Sir Paul’s creative juices and calm his frayed nerves. Little did I expect that my well-intentioned suggestion would have such far-reaching consequences. In all innocence, I had no idea how strained things had become between Paul and Heather. In mitigation, I should point out that Dr Whipsnade went beyond his remit when he visited the McCartney residence. He has since briefed me on the events of that fateful afternoon."

There is red and white and rose for the ladies. These wines are sub divided into cheap stuff that makes you wince and takes a few swigs to get the hang of, mid priced stuff that doesn’t make you wince and you are better off buying if you either have a lady friend or wish to impress a lady and the really pricey stuff that appears little better than the mid priced stuff that is great to neck if someone else is picking up the bill. I am aware there are grape varieties, countries and regions that subdivide wine further but have never ventured into discovering this due to a lack of interest in something I have long considered to be a poncy way of getting pissed. I prefer a more egalitarian way of getting pissed, hence my love of beer and more specifically cheap beer."
3266,"'Confer' is derived from the Latin 'conferre' which harbours three meanings: to compile, to bestow and to compare. Inevitably, as a first collection, 'to compile' is particularly resonant, encompassing as it does the peculiar practice of gathering together and ordering one's poems."

3268,"But ultimately, neither pairing was wrong, they were just different. Lost was confusing everybody because it was telling two love stories simultaneously: the classic romance, and the sensational, epic love story. Of course, the additional twist was that the show was telling these stories with the same female character - thus in a way symbolising the conflict in contemporary society between the old and the new, between the beautiful and the amplified. There is a general fear of losing the ""high culture"" in an over-saturated, media crazed society, and postmodernist television is (while brilliant in a lot of ways) dissolving the barrier the low and the high culture. Lost is taking this to a whole new level, by literally staging a battle for dominance between these two types of storytelling, these two different approaches to romance - using the characters Jack and Sawyer as champions for the two sides. Whether Jack and Kate ending up together signals a return to romance as it used to be, or whether it just shows it to be more eternal, lasting and memorable, is up for debate."

I understand that crappy things are still going to happen but if we respond instead of react, the results of those crappy things will be completely different. A response is something you think about and then do. A reaction is exactly that – action without premeditation. It’s like a parallel universe. In one, life sucks and so does everything in it.

Their food and beer both are excellent, and this event always has a nice strong bock (among other choices), tasty German food, polka bands, and activities for the kids. Any event that lets me drink beer while my kids have fun is a good thing. Which leads me to my don't-miss event of the year …"

Michael discusses how geneabloggers are becoming viewed as something akin to experts in the field of genealogy. He also points out the lagging membership of genealogy societies, the importance of an online presence and support of these local societies. There were a lot of very interesting points made in the article, it's insightful, and I think it is a great read."

3308,"This is slightly more difficult; you’ll have to worry about an early-game Marine + Marauder attack. Or, even the Marine + SCV rush, which has recently surging success. To really survive against this, you’ll need a lot of Zealots and a lot of Cannons. Massing Cannons is extremely productive. Also, you’ll probably want to go with a Void Ray + Carrier + Mothership attack rather than just Void Rays. However, you’ll want to obtain an early Void Ray anyway to possibly harass your opponent’s economy and/or expansions. Just be careful: If your attack is too slow, your opponent’s Scanner Sweep can pick up on your aerial intentions. If possible, do a lot of teching. Upgrades, especially in weapons, will help. If map space allows, you can even consider moving your main air force out of your main base, just so a Scanner Sweep won’t get vital information."

So when people told me that it is also a nice place to dance, I took instantly the decision to catch a train and meet the MuSaCa tango tribe! Even though I had been in Geneva before…. And then I realized several things… Firstly the milonga is more of my taste rather than the dish! Secondly, even though I’ve spent 5 days in the city 3 years ago, I haven’t quite known it, a fact that highlights the great advantages of tango tourism. And last but not least, I loved the Swiss people, the way they are and they live."

I wondered if it could find enough to eat, and thought this unlikely–it’s not the improbability but the upkeep on monsters that worries me. Did Aleister Crowley have opinions on the subject? He apparently had not expressed himself....We talked about Wilhelm Reich’s orgone accumulator, and I showed him plans for making this device, which were passed along to me by Reich’s daughter. Basically the device is very simple, consisting of iron or steel wool on the inside and organic material on the outside. I think this was highly important discovery. Recently a scientist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced an “electrical cell” theory of cancer that is almost identical to Reich’s cancer theory put forth 25 years ago. He does not acknowledge any indebtedness to Reich. I showed Jimmy the orgone box I have here, and we agreed that orgone accumulators in pyramid form and/or using magnetized iron could be much more powerful.Yes, it's all like that.

Sheesh. This guy calls himself a doctor? He also obviously woefully misunderstands quantum physics, and mistakes Dawkins for some sort of 19th century objective materialist who subscribes only to the narrowest interpretations of Newtonian physics.

We can think thoughts with our mind, which has to be more than just the chemicals it's made of. Well doesn't it?

So even if your mind insists that you were provoked by another, only you can help yourself by letting the lingering feeling flush through you. When someone has been on the receiving end of violence from another person, they do not go back to that person and ask them to heal the bruises they inflicted. They retreat and let the body do it’s inner work. The same principle applies here for peace."
3443,"I was a student at NYU in the mid-70s when a film crew took over 9th avenue (aka Prospect Park West) around the corner from my home on 17th Street in Windsor Terrace. Some old storefronts were reconfigured into a bank and the great Al Pacino, fresh from his Godfather 2 triumph, explored a new character in Sidney Lumet's classic Dog Day Afternoon. Sharing the screen was another remarkable actor, John Cazale, probably best known as Fredo in the Godfather series. Cazale appeared in only 5 films before he succumbed to cancer at the age of 42 but they were all critical, box office and Oscar favorites. A mainstay of the New York off-Broadway theater scene, Cazale was an enormous talent, and director Richard Shepard (Scotland, PA and The Matador) has created a touching and fascinating film portrait of his too brief career."

A Paddling of Ducks: Animals in Groups from A to Z by Marjorie Blain Parker and Joseph Kelly is marvelously illustrated and creates groups that include a “Bask of Crocodiles” and a “Skulk of Foxes” to reinforce the alphabet and introduce a young reader to all manner of creatures from Yellow Jackets to zebra in a very entertaining fashion. Melanie Watt created Chester the cat, a rather self-centered feline, and his latest manifestation occurs in Chester’s Masterpiece ($18.95) in which she admonishes Chester not to copy other people’s writings as he attempts to write his own book. Will he write humor, action, drama, suspense, horror, science fiction, or romance? The results will be hilarious to any young reader who will begin to think about writing their own book, too! An older reader, age 10 to 12, will surely enjoy Evolution: How We and All Living Things Came to Be by Daniel Loxton ($18.95) with an excellent text and extraordinary computer-generated images, illustrations and photos that demonstrate how various species evolved over millions of years.

I also made my segments as one-eighth of a circle to maximise what I could fit on an 8’ x 4’ sheet of 6mm ply with minimum waste. The helix requires 80 of these segments, 16 per level. As mentioned in the article, these get laminated together to form a roadbed of 12mm thickness which should be very strong and not require any splice plates. Splice plates have the disadvantage of reducing the clearance between levels."
3495,"For my final three projects, I decided to investigate three instances where people were helping the environment two of which were making money. For one, I visited the United By Blue cleanup on Tue, May 1, 5pm – 7pm, Bartram’s Garden, 54th St. and Lindbergh Blvd. For the other, I visited the Collegeville Farmer’s Market, Sat, May 5, 9am – 1pm, 460 East Main Street, Collegeville, PA. In the former case, the company was working on the environment and their business model in equal importance. The second was full of many people of different backgrounds, all of whom cared about the environment to some degree, but found its care incidental. For the third case, where there was little to no profit, I spoke with an artist and a gardener who were in charge of the outdoor art installation called Deep Roots, at Elkins Park Front Yard Farm, 7607 Spring Ave, Elkins Park, PA 19027, on May 5th 2012, who enjoy caring for the environment and working within it to create something beautiful.

A vampire is a pale, handsome man with a plastic smile and eyes so dark they seem like pits. His handshake is cool, hard, and with no sign of a pulse–like shaking the hand of a store mannequin. The zombies that are chasing you? Describe their smell. Describe the sound of their bloody feet spattering against the pavement as they shamble closer. Your gun doesn’t do ’7 points of damage’, it rips a bloody hole through the fleshy part of the alien’s bat-like wings, releasing a stale odor of something cold and ancient that tingles at the back of your throat. Now, its beetley head and compound eyes swivel from the child half-eaten by its gory mandibles and, in a way that chills your bones, you know that it sees you. And it hates."

It's even made a material part of the film, as she's forced to change out of her bright white dress during a night-time flight from the posse, who are more sensibly dressed in their funereal blacks to blend into the darkness. With the change, Vienna opts for dark blue pants to blend into the Hollywood night, and a red blouse that initially seems as ill-advised as the white dress until one sees Vienna positioned amidst the similarly reddish studio rocks of the surrounding countryside. In the wild, she'd stick out absurdly; in the garish studio West where she's most comfortable, she's a chameleon."

Into this throw a mid 20's Vietnamese man and a early 40's Green party member woman ""from the city"" and perhaps you have a rough idea already as to the timbre of joke. Julian urged me time and time again to look past what seems obvious, and most easily laudable, and instead try and look at what the playwright was actually working with. The idea of Australia Day - clearly, politics - certainly, a sort of country vs city energy (and extending from that the haves and the have-nots) and among that tackling morality and the notion of morality. I'm not saying that any if it was handled deftly, just that it was handled."
3577,"In a scene which utterly traumatised me as a child, Data (Brent Spiner) from off've Star Trek is murdered by one of the aliens. For all the unsubtle explosions and hoo-ha-ing, Independence Day has its moments of genuine creepiness and unease. It doesn't rely too much on special effects, unlike the director's most recent, duller works. Alien spaceships and slithering monsters are far more interesting to watch than John Cusack or Dennis Quaid pouting at earthquakes."

Intentional or not, it sounded like a spoof of the The A-Team. Bombino came on stage after the monologue with an acoustic guitar. He treated the crowd to some beautiful ballads, but it was Friday night and no one was there for nylon strings. By the third tune, you could sense the anxiety in the crowd… “shit, is this an acoustic set?”."

In a composite environment, corn resin is 99% biodegradable to carbon dioxide and water within 365 days. Since it’s made from corn, it comes from a renewable resource. Conventional plastics use an estimated 200,000 barrels of oil a day in the United States alone but because corn resin is bio-based, it therefore uses no oil resources in production"

3615,"Then, you should include a sampling of images that would appear in the book. I know this sounds obvious, but you would be amazed by how many proposals we receive that have no images. How are we supposed to judge the merits of a visual project without seeing the visuals?! The number of images really depends on the content, but you should include at least 10-15. The best way, in my opinion, to send images is in a lo-res, emailable PDF. Don’t bother to “design” your images or lay them out as you imagine they would appear in the book. This can actually hurt your proposal if your aesthetic doesn’t match the house you’re pitching and it may be harder to see the potential in images if they’re over-designed. Simple, full-bleed images in a PDF are ideal for easy viewing and distribution. If you’re sending a hard copy, same rules apply. One large image per page is fine. There’s one exception: graphic design proposals. Since design is an integral element to your book, we do want to see designed sample spreads."

I've left the more titillating aspects of her biography for others to tell and if you are interested, this is one of many articles that will bring you up to speed on facets of her life that are not included here. I knew very little about her until I began to gather information for this post. Not all the luminaries from the early days of the NYC food scene had reputations that made it past the Hudson River. At that time, Craig Claiborne, Mimi Sheraton and Marian Burros were well-known in the Chicago area, and, being nothing if not loyal, those were the names I carried with me when we made the reverse migration from Chicago to New York. For better or worse, I was a New York Times gal. Gael wrote for the New York Post and New York magazine, so I'm embarrassed to say her columns were never on my radar. Following graduation from the University of Michigan, she began her career as a reporter and freelance writer. She became a restaurant critic only after being asked to do a column for New York magazine. She took the job because association with the gifted pool of writers on the magazine roster would be interesting, and, better still, those costly meals for which she became famous could be expensed. Later, it became the vehicle that afforded her time to work on her novels, a list of which can be found here. These days, she still does freelance writing and serves as a judge on the television program, Top Chef. She is probably best known for her role as co-founder of Citymeals-on-Wheels, an organization that raises funds to deliver food to the housebound elderly."

Bank of America may actually cut 10,000 jobs which would mean a 3.5% reduction of their work force. When the biggest financial institutions are opting to run skeleton crews we are in serious trouble. Most jobs in America are service jobs or financial jobs. I say we need a radical reduction in CEO compensation.

Last night, when our pitcher was about to fall apart because the other coach kept yelling balk, our coach told him that he didn't care how many times they called balk or how many runs scored, his only desire was for the kid to have fun. Despite the fact that we were losing, and that we have other pitchers who might have been able to do better, he just let the boy finish out the game and then congratulated him on how he played. That little boy's feelings were more important to him than the outcome of the game. Then, after the game, they were able to talk to the umpire and get a lesson on how to pick off a runner on third without getting called for a balk."

3654,The first thing Delysia does is take her to a lingerie fashion show where Pettigrew becomes enamored with lingerie designer Joe Blomfield (Ciaran Hinds) who is involved in a tempestuous relationship with salon owner Edythe Dubarry (Shirley Henderson). The gradually emerging romance between Joe and Pettigrew is the film’s most charming subplot and by the film’s end we want to see further adventures of these two characters. Edythe and Delysia team up to give Pettigrew a complete makeover so that she no longer looks like a dowdy bag lady.
3655,"Compare hope to any of the other ethical virtues celebrated in that harsh time and the distinction is even clearer. Courage, for example, isn’t a facile assurance that one is destined to win. It’s the quality of character and the act of will that does the right thing in the face of danger and fear. This is, among other things, the opposite of the conviction that victory is inevitable. That’s a logical point—if someone recognizes no danger and feels no fear, he’s not courageous no matter how many risks he unknowingly runs—but it’s also a practical one. One of the commonplaces of military history, for example, is the army that believes it can’t lose, and then collapses in panic when the battle turns against it because it has never had to grapple with the possibility of defeat."

3665,"Water spraying and the use of materials such as boron and sand would appear the most relevant. The risk is that, with water spraying on Fukushima-Daiichi unit 4 following a loss of the cooling water and even collapse of the building, this could make the situation worse – if the spent fuel rods have gone beyond 900 degrees then the water will provide further oxidation helping to release more radio-nuclides into the atmosphere.

NAMA will have 7% or so of assets in the Rest of World. NAMA’s LEV as a percentage of CMV may change. So far this year in Ireland residential is off 5% (to the end of Q1) and commercial 8% (to the end of Q2) and the UK is broadly positive, so we have some way to drop before we get to the EU benchmark scenario. There are other assumptions but it is a fair representation, I believe, to say that we are overpaying by billions for NAMA loans by reference to current values – some overpayment was planned via the Long Term Economic Value device but the overpayment being referred to here is on top of that."

This flavor is also quite bitter, it dries the mouth out completely, slowly mellowing out in the aftertaste. It really didn’t invite me in for another taste. Starting from about cellar temperature I left the beer to warm a little, which does kill off some of the harshness, probably by letting some of the bubbles escape."

But whenever I think of her, I think of the time that dad would come home at the end of the day, I can still remember the sight of the two of them performing their daily ritual of a big kiss on the lips, one that you could also hear the sound of way down the hall. The memory that is my most bittersweet is the time she suffered her final heart attack, and as the paramedics were wheeling her out to the ambulance, she looked up at me, with a loving smile and whispered, ""Take good care of yourself, Willie......It's your turn now."""
3715,Despite the dominate narrative of the Arab Spring – as a collection of uprisings linked by common cause against authoritarianism in the Arab world – Tunisian public debate has been largely insulated from events elsewhere in the Arab world. While Tunisians are aware of and sympathetic toward the other uprisings – especially in Libya and Egypt – there has been little public discussion of the paths toward democracy these countries have taken. Tunisians rightly see their path as a model to follow – rather than the violent and chaotic paths followed by their neighbors.

(even if tanker is diesel and theres a compatability prob at least the plot could have addressed this.) this judgement in error is the difference between having a movie that keeps me fully involved and invested in the characters because their acumen is worth giving 2 hours to, or having movie characters that seem to keep ”hacking it” with the dullest knives in the drawer… in some cases, movie characters make such poor choices I hope they die as quickly as possible. why wait for them to bumble to the end? exhibit b: the main character in “blink”, played by madeline stowe. just saw that on sunday. spoiler alert. she plays a “strong” “resilient” woman who can “survive on her own”, is “super smart” and “aint taking shit from anybody”. the hero guy in the movie assaults her twice and she still has sex with him. each time. ummm. no. a vicious killer breaks into her house, stalks her, etc and she still decides she doesnt need police protection in the middle of a rainy night in an unknown desolate part of town. ummm. no. as ive b een saying for a while. “we gots to do better” for our characters. and our audience."

3724,"On my last night there, I was writing (as Victoria Lamb) a scene where Shakespeare, as a young theatrical, returns to his home town of Stratford, not far from Coventry, to see his wife Anne. Although sitting in a modern city centre hotel, it was surprisingly easy to imagine myself back in sixteenth century Warwickshire, for Coventry is a medieval city itself and steeped in history. Indeed, it's a city that Shakespeare would probably have known well; he may even have visited its magnificent medieval cathedral once or twice, now a burnt-out shell courtesy of bombing raids across the industrial Midlands during World War II."

3726,"Mostly I was just curious. I was a part of a writing group and had read that in today’s market, to sell a book, a writer MUST have a blog. I started one early in 2009 simply as part of my plan to be a writer. That’s when I started Twitter, too — also under a pseudonym. I was obsessive about it and saw it as “my job” — because I saw writing as my job, and marketing was a necessary part of it. Every writer I knew blogged about the same thing: how to be a writer, advice about how to be a writer, what it felt like to be a writer, etc. I tried to follow the pack (since I assumed that was what I had to do to succeed.) I followed everyone on Twitter who followed me, I commented on every single post that came up on Google Reader and followed every single person that followed me. I wrote about how to write, how not to write, how to be successful — until I realized I was a novice and had no place writing such posts. Every writer’s blog I followed was offering up the same advice, and it started to feel very constricting to me. Not that others might choose to blog this way, but that it should be expected of me, as a means to sell."

3760,"It may seem strange to talk about bureaucracy in a terror organization, but without it the organization can deviate from its original ideology and become just another criminal organization. FARC, as an example, started out as a Marxist/Communist terror group in Colombia and is one of the oldest terror organizations around. In the 1980's it started picking up the Enforcer role for some of the drug cartels to ensure supply via terrorism applied to local communities, and when the cartels started to crumble FARC picked up on narco-terrorism as its main methodology. Unfortunately that is no longer even close to being in the Marxist/Communist realm and FARC graduated from ideologically based terrorism to become a narco-terrorist organization which was also capitalist in its means. FARC stopped being about anything, save for money and power. The secretive Shining Path, on the other hand, continues its smoldering and pretty useless terror campaign by remaining ideologically pure. The various Red organizations of the 1970's that dabbled in terror started out from a few, central terror organizations, but then had internal ideological disputes so that Red factions and Red groups and militant interior designers all started to show up on the terror landscape. Hezbollah remains largely an arm of the Iranian regime, but now has large external support bases so that it can work in ways that can often be at cross-purposes to Iran. The PLO factionated when it sought to become semi-legitimate and some of its virulent off-shoots went out on their own and some allied with HAMAS, the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood solves this, to a degree, by spinning off new terror organization (Tunisia, Algeria, HAMAS, al Qaeda) but finds that some of these don't really work to the overall benefit of the MB. They give up control and get negative feedback."

I could empathize with them even though my children have not had to go through anything so extreme.

We were told by the receptionist not to worry about our $20 co-pay because we had a ""credit"" there from them overcharging us from the previous surgery because our insurance paid more than they had estimated. I asked what amount, and it was nearly $240! I demanded to know why we had not received a reimbursement check in a year and a half especially because we had no reason to return and use the credit there!

He arranged for an English translation of the Bible to be provided for every parish church. Once Henry was succeeded by Edward, Thomas was able to bring in more reforms. He wrote much of the Book of Common Prayer. He also wrote the Forty-two Articles which eventually became the Thirty-nine Articles as we have them now. When Mary came to the throne Cranmer wrote a letter of submission to the Pope and Roman Catholic doctrines despite his Protestant beliefs. Mary did not believe that the submission was genuine and had him arrested. He was burned at the stake in Oxford on 21st March 1556. As he went to his death he withdrew his submission saying, “I have sinned, in that I signed with my hand what I did not believe with my heart. When the flames are lit, this hand shall be the first to burn.” Once the fire was burning he held his right hand in it until it burned away."

3839,"A painting done outside rather than in a studio is said to be painted “en plein air”. The term comes from the French en plein air, meaning ‘in the open air’. It seems like most aspects of getting away on a Sunday to paint would be relaxing. It seems like a great experience to paint with others and also dedicate time to getting back into the love of painting. It will also serve as a creative change of scenery as it places me outside of my bead-making studio. During a plein air experience, I will also be dealing with space and supply limitations, weather conditions, gnats and insects, travel issues to find the different paint locations, and light changes. All are creative obstacles that make the whole experience memorable and unique. I look forward to each experience as a creative and learning situation."

3854,"Orthodox Christians, having dedicated themselves to Christ and adhering to the ancient Orthodox Christian Faith, believe in one God the Father, who eternally shares His Divine Essence with His Son and His Holy Spirit, as professed in the earliest baptismal creeds. Just as God is a loving Communion of Persons, so also He created Man in His Image and sent His Son to establish the Church, that man may also become a loving communion of persons in Him. Thus the Second Person of the Trinity, from all eternity, willed to become Incarnate of the Virgin Mary, truly becoming human but truly retaining His Father’s God-nature which He had with the Father before time began. Since He kept His Father’s God-nature even when he became man, the Church has called the Virgin Mary the Theotokos, the maternal bearer and mother of God. For she gave Him flesh (through her “the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us”–John 1.14), and carried Him within her and then reared him, caring for his growing humanity and reverencing his eternal divinity. Though the entirety of the Church in one sense is collectively called “the saints,” yet also Scripture tells us that while still in this world we as individuals still “aspire to be saints,” and thus look toward those who have “finished the race” (2 Tim. 4.7) who are counted “worthy of double honor” (1 Tim. 5.17) who say with St. Paul, “imitate me as I imitate Christ” (1 Cor. 11.1; 4.16)."

I've never seen that shit before, but it was pretty sweet. He could totally slice a dude up with his feet before the poor bastard knew what hit him. There was a cool little fight scene with him and JCVD that was well lit and a bit stylish that ends in a satisfying way if you find spur man's dumbass look at all annoying like I did.

I checked the web for an answer. But I also decided that it would be just as easy and reliable to call my local Chevrolet dealer to get the answer, or at least to confirm that what I found on-line was correct for the year of the Corvette in my story. It’s easy to be lazy about research these days, but don’t be afraid to expand your research beyond the web. It may make the difference between finding the right answer and being misled."

Today is simply a good day to let some of the people around you know, “I see your immaturity.” For those that think that maturity is a fancy car, job or wearing heels, you have it twisted.

Under the masterful direction of DeLoss Dodds, the Shorthorns had nearly conquered all lands and peoples in the known world. Driven by world-class talent, superior coaching, inexhaustible resources, and a fanbase of millions, the Texas Empire extended from El Paso to Orange and from Amarillo to Harlingen. Within a two year-period, the Horns delivered a 2003 Final Four Appearance in men's basketball, a fabled 2005 College World Series championship in baseball (devastating a small religious community in the process), and most significantly, the 2006 Rose Bowl victory over the godless Southern Californians."

Here was something I wanted so badly for him and he was able to brush it off with relative ease. That was not only surprising, it actually stung a bit.

The story builds gradually, carrying the reader through the life of the protagonist, Katniss, letting the reader fully understand her, her community, her society. At first, I found the pace of the story to be a bit slow but this is done to give the reader a strong sense of the protagonist and also to ensure that the reader understands what type of society Katniss resides in. The development of Katniss was well done. She is unforgettable. I apologize for going on like this about her when I haven’t even given a brief about the story but Katniss is one of my favorite female protagonists. She jumps out at you as soon as you begin to read and stays with you after you have finished."

For there it shall be afflicted, while the just rejoice; all the things that are now for its peace, will then be changed into bitterness of contention: for it will begin to rage within itself, for having closed its eyes from seeing the evils to come. For this reason He says to it: but now they are hidden from thine eyes. For the perverse soul that is given over to temporal things, and weakened by bodily pleasures, blinds itself to the evils that pursue it; for it turns from looking ahead at things to come, lest they trouble its present delight. And in abandoning itself to the allurements of this life, what else is it doing but hurrying with closed eyes towards the everlasting fire?"

When I was heading out, I somehow got into this conversation with this lady, her name is Ana. She speaks such little English, and I speak such little Russian that the whole conversation took a super long time to figure out. Basically what I got after about ten minutes of talking is that her name is Ana, she’s Maxim’s mom, she teaches piano (and loves it!), and had some music for me if I want to have it. There was a lot more between, like how I absolutely love music - Ya (I) OCHEN (VERY) lyoublyou (love) musik! (music!), or how Maxim learned piano for three years, but then didn’t like it so quit. I really loved talking to Ana, I could tell she enjoyed the conversation too. Eventually someone came and asked if we needed a translator. I asked Ana, and I think she said that she didn’t; It was too fun trying to talk to her and recall the oh-so-few words that I even know in Russian. He translated a little anyways, saying that Ana didn’t know when she could get the music to me because she hardly ever sees me. We figured next Friday at FHE would work perfectly. We all headed out together and Ana and Maxim ended up walking me almost all the way home. Maxim didn't talk much, but Ana talked enough for the both of them :) We talked and laughed and learned words the whole way. My perception of the “gift of tongues” has definitely changed after my conversation with her. I in no way was able to fluently talk to her, but the “language barrier” between us seemed to be quite broken as I forged this new friendship even without understanding hardly a thing being said. That night, I had some great conversations with Lena and Sasha and George-o. We talked about how sometimes you can say something and people don’t understand it, but"

3982,"The acting in Black Swan is commendable too, particularly the full goose-looney central performance of Natalie Portman (easily her best screen work so far, which is truly saying something), the type of acting turn that brings on both Oscar nominations and also a fury of hipster hating. Accused by some cinephile’s of pandering with the success of The Wrestler, Aronofsky is back in more rarified territory here, and the film is peppered with references to the greatest ballet film of all, The Red Shoes, but also to another memorable movie made by the same director Michael Powell, Black Narcissus, and it also unabashedly alludes to both the high brow psychological frisson of Roman Polanski and the pulpy machinations of Brian DePalma. A weird and potent mix. Barbara Hershey registers strongly as a very smothering stage mother, while Mila Kunis is something of a revelation as a fellow ballerina who is hard to distinguish as friend or foe."

So I cut the largest doily in Hawaiian Shores card stock from Papertrey Ink. I then die cut a circle nestability to sit inside the doily. For some reason I decided to sponge Hibiscus Burst ink from PTI around the white circle and now wish that I hadn't. I just think it would have looked nicer if it were plain old white. Lesson learned I guess. I used my Curly Label punch from SU! and stamped it with versa mark chalk ink. It's the only ink that I have that matches perfectly with Hawaiian Shores. I also used some Prima flowers and baker's twine. I added one little pearl to the centre of the flower on Emma's t-shirt and then around the doily and that's pretty much it! Here is a close up ..."

Now at an angle to accentuate a sense of space, with a slick new look and LED lit bar front, the new Upper Class bar really accentuates what makes the whole Upper Class cabin experience, created by a mix of mood lighting and modern slick lines. It looks more nightclub than cabin, and has really latched onto what makes it cool to be a Virgin Atlantic passenger. Talking about their new product, VW+BS tell me “The entry point for our thinking was that the bar is positioned at the entry point to the plane. It had to make an immediate impression. After take-off the bar had to become a destination. We wanted to orient the bar within the space to make this impact and to create a genuinely convivial space, that reflected trends happening on the ground with pop-up bars and the new speak easy, while having an aesthetic that was decidedly futuristic and belonged in the sky”"

In 1958, when she was age of seven, her mother held a rifle to her head and pulled the trigger. The gun jammed and she was taken away for the first of many visits to a mental hospital. Other suicide attempts would follow and the author chronicles forty years of her relationship with her mother and the way it was affected by the changes in the social landscape of their time. She was the sole caretaker of her mother and it was not until she left for college in Iowa that she was able to break the dysfunctional bonds and find her own space which included her own lesbianism.

We are just coming from the Easter season and into a different time, but we need to stay mindful of the miracles that Christ performed and be thankful daily for the sacrifices that He made. Basically, we need to be just like Him, and by nature we need to live every day like it may be our last. We need to start living like we were dying. Not sure how to do that? Well, here is a few examples to chew on and see how they feel to you. Give to a charity, support a child abroad, go and serve in the community, give without thinking, and step out of your comfort zone to make a difference with as many people as you can. Go do the Lord’s bidding – no matter what that entails. Remember that His way is perfect, and yours is not. This is as hard of a statement to accept as any that you will try to pursue in your faith, but God has made the rewards so worthy of this challenge. Now, as I think about my family, and the small contributions that we make, we do a lot on that list. We would never have done things like we have done in the last year – including trying to support a child overseas.* There was only one thing that I have not seen enough out of us on that list, and that would be giving without thinking.

We don't even really believe that he's capable of changing. His lifestyle and my lifestyle did not mesh. At all. He is super social, he likes to sit around with the guys daily and drink beer and tell the same stories fifty times over, he is ok with and wants someone to live at home with his parents with him, he is carefree and lives spontaneously. I CANNOT do any of that. I am not social. I hate sitting around and making small talk and telling stories.

Those who carried the regimental flag into the fight could not carry a weapon, as both hands were required to raise the flag and keep it aloft for the rest of the unit to follow. As a result, the enemies fired at the color bearer more than any other soldier, because if the flag fell, those following it could not continue their charge. On the opposite side, those attacking could not allow the flag to fall. Therefore, as one color bearer was shot down, another, and another would grasp the standard and carry it onward."

I have no idea what I am going to do with it, because I am not sure I’ll actually wear it, but it was fun to sit down at the sewing machine and make something."
4240,"Oh, and to the head of Vote FOR Marriage NC: we used to think that G-d’s “natural order of things” also involved a racial hierarchy, which we now see was just us being racists. It is possible that we just don’t know what G-d, if there is a G-d, wanted. Maybe we should leave Him/Her out of our politics."

Normally I don’t visit Thai restaurants outside of Seattle since we’ve got some great ones but I was very pleased by the food.

4247,"The claim that there is something (the quality of phenomenal experience) that cannot be explained by physical science is strictly analogous to the 19th century “vitalist” claim that the property of being alive could not be explained by physical science (the phrase “élan vital” was actually coined later, in 1907, by Henri Bergson in his book Creative Evolution). Consider all of the physical facts about physical states and processes in the body, the vitalist argued: singularly or together none of these facts entail that the body be alive."
4248,"This week I feel like I made some decent progress. I've been working on scrap projects and haven't actually purchased fabric in quite a while. I don't have a fabric stash per se, but I had accumulated a fair amount of scraps over the last year or so since I started quilting. And now I'm feeling pretty good that I have depleted the majority of my scraps and will be looking to start something ""from scratch"" pretty soon. :)"

4254,"I grew up in a home where I felt constantly downed by various female figures in my life. Whether it be my weight problem, my eyebrow plucking (or lack thereof) as a teenager or something else, I hardly ever got positive affirmations from them growing up.

Hey, at least the door was clean!"
4260,"In the years before “Dallas”, Larry Hagman was best known as the button-down astronaut who dreamed of Jeannie. But secretly he had a wild streak high and wide enough to land a 747 on. When he wasn’t toasting another sunrise with his next-door neighbor Keith Moon or dropping acid with David Crosby he was working hard to get this, his dream project, made. It’s a very strange, very loose sequel to the 1958 teen horror classic THE BLOB. The free-wheeling performances and absurdist humor are unlike any other movie we’ve ever seen. Hagman was obsessed with making this movie, often going without sleep for days on end, deeply worrying his friends and associates. Unfortunately the film was critically ignored upon release and Hagman retreated to the forest where he lived like an animal for several years before accepting the role of J.R. Ewing and returning to the forefront of American consciousness as the man you love to hate. More popular than ever, he was nonetheless a scorned and broken man whose one-of-a-kind film-making genius has never been fully appreciated. Until now. Join us for this very rare screening of Larry Hagman’s one and only film as a director, starring Robert Walker Jr., Burgess Meredith, Godfrey Cambridge, Marlene Clark, Gerrit Graham, and Shelly Berman.

4262,"That is “organic RP” in a nutshell – roleplaying that (1) relates to and is derived from our characters as living organisms, and (2) that forms an integral element of the whole of our guild experience. Ultimately, our guild exists to facilitate shared social experiences. We do that by promoting organic roleplaying, and we also do a mixture of 5-man dungeon PvE content and PvE raiding content. Whatever we do, however, should ultimately promote positive shared social experiences, because, while it is fun to play a game, an MMORPG is nothing without the second “M” – Multiplayer. MMOs, and especially MMORPGs, are about people, and we want to encourage people not just to have fun, but to make friends. We hope that you’ll join us, have a wonderful time, and make some new friends."

4265,"My closet is full of shoes I have worn in shows. Sadly, the go-go boots and Tweety Bird hi-tops have worn through and gone to the trash heap, but I still have the yellow patent Blanche DuBois T-straps, Elmire’s red satin mules, and the combat-style boots I wore in as Neasa in Quotidian’s Shining City last fall. So I was not surprised when, even before the first rehearsal, our costume designer Stephanie Mumford emailed me a photograph of the shoes I will wear as Agnes, the character I am playing in Dancing at Lughnasa."

4268,"Another thing that was tough, especially at the beginning, was when I was working at home, and I could hear Toby crying in the other room. The sound was heartbreaking to me, but I couldn’t go out to him because I was busy working or on a conference call—and plus I had to respect the sitter and trust her to take care of him. There's a certain stress of being on deadline, and a certain stress of hearing your baby cry, and I was getting both at once. (And when I heard him playing and laughing, I would want to go out to him, too!) I do crave some mental and physical distance from the baby while I'm working."
4269,"I spent my lunch time in prayer for this boy. I turned to 2 Chron 6 where I read this on the sidebar of my Bible. ""Others may doubt our sincerity, our passion and our purpose, but God, who looks beyond what others see, knows our genuine heart's desire."" This made me think of our SW who felt that we were pursuing the boy only because we felt sorry for him and our desire to ""rescue"" him. While the fact that he was losing his chance for a family certainly played a part - it wasn't the only part. I had never felt a fire burn in me before the way a fire burned in me when I read that blog post about him. I knew I had to do something. The last phrase ""our genuine heart's desire"" also spoke to me since Psalm 37:4 (Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart. ) was the verse I held on to during HJ's adoption."

4286,"Anyway, back to Russell. His family and my family were friends and Russell and I were the same age. We stayed at the same babysitter’s house since they didn’t have formal preschool in those days. Sometimes when our parents would go out together in the evenings, they’d drop us off at the sitter’s house and we’d either stay until our parents got back or spend the night. Russell and I had a blast together ’cause I’d been raised so much like a boy by my father that I didn’t mind getting muddy in the yard or trying to catch crawfish with my bare hands in the ditch at the end of the road and I watched all of the TV shows that the rest of the guys liked. I fit right in. Heck, my babysitter figured I “fit-in” well enough that I do have the memory of bath time at her house one night."

I’ll often write several first drafts until I’ve found the right angle. ""Kiss"", the first story in the book, was written at least half a dozen times from different points of view – I think a daughter narrated the story at the beginning. And once that’s done there’s considerable redrafting and tweaking, and read-throughs. So a story as short as ""When You’re Frightened, Honey, Think of Strawberries"", can take a week or two to finish – which could be the same length as something six or seven times as long. But then others come out pretty much already done; ""I think Seconds Are Ticking By"" was done in an afternoon."

4302,"We were up at 5am one morning, tuk-tukked to the site, saw Angkor Wat at sunrise, silhouettes mainly, nice but, and we watched the ambitious Japanese use flash cameras to capture the rosy-fingered dawn. By the third day however, when our promised sunset shoot was scheduled (much more dramatic, with the golden-hued temple looking magnificent - E@L can confirm that from last time he was here, in 2000) we were too buggered to fufil our goals, promised ourselves instead to look at the sunset from our balcony, and so we crashed, gin&tonic exhausted, by the pool or back in the room.

Keeping the status quo and the prosperity being enjoyed by a majority of Americans led to his overwhelming victory in the election of 1924. Coolidge spent most of his presidency restoring America's faith in the office after the scandals of the Harding administration and left office with high popularity.

He quickly admitted that he has much to learn in terms of making that really work successfully, but he's certainly enjoying a greater level of involvement in family life, and a closer relationship with his kids. He talked about how most men live a life where ""success"" is very sequential. They go through school, get into the best uni possible, get the best job possible, work their way up the ranks and ta da! Success. They often see school and education in the same light: they seek out the ""best school"" for their kids, send them off and read the report cards. So for men who have wives that are strong enough to buck the system and keep their kids at home, and particularly for men whose wives are drawn to the unschooling philosophy, it can be a great challenge to accept this! He talked about the importance of finding a supportive unschooling community of friends. He also talked about how Dads can feel isolated and left behind even within their own family, and how it's really important for them to make the most of the opportunities they do have at home. He talked about a car trip they did where he had to make some business calls. He told the kids that either they could stop the car so he could talk on the side of the road in peace, or they could be quiet so he could talk while his wife kept driving. They decided to be quiet!! Then, when they got there, he still had more business calls to make, but by this time he was walking barefoot along the beach whilst talking."

In one point in history the Romans erected a wall to keep the untamed barbarians at bay. This edifice is referred to as Hadrian’s Wall. The Wall was erected as a barrier and line of defense protecting the Roman legions from the Scottish devils. Up to this point in time Rome was yet to be defeated. The Roman legions strode their way through most of the known world. They easily conquered the Gauls, barbarians of France, and the Teutons of Germany.

If and when help comes – because, who knows, I may never get the treatment I need, especially as growth hormone is expensive and may not be considered vital to me, given that I have survived this long without it – then I will be grateful. In the meantime, there is plenty to keep me going, and even the odd synchronicitous event to remind me that life is more mysterious than we generally give it credit for. I’m going to make the most of all the things that give me pleasure – music, books, writing and family – and keep trying to put one foot in front of the other with as much verve, vibrancy and vivacity as I can muster."

4366,"As I think about ‘having to go to church’, I find myself asking a much bigger question, “Why would anyone want to miss church?” It is then that I realize how many truly bad church experiences there are out there. I feel badly for some of the churches I dragged my kids into. As I reflect on what those were, I think to myself, “I wished I would have missed many of those Sundays!” Why? Because they weren’t an accurate representation of what church is supposed to be."

4378,"All this ‘fictional, ‘filmy’ blah blah is fine, but where the film actually scores ‘flat-out brilliance’ points is the entire Abraham (Emraan) and Silk (Vidya) thread. Though a tad under-developed, it was so refreshing to see such a man-woman equation in a hindi movie. As I mentioned earlier, all the elements of this equation, like male-insecurity, jealousy, craving for the ‘prohibited’, are all there in the dialogues. Maybe you can say its less ‘showing’ more ‘telling’, but Emraan and Vidya, both have such scorching screen presence that when dialogues are delivered they work like fireworks celebrating the very existence of ‘dialogue-baazi’ in our movies. If both would’ve just exchanged looks without the dialogues the screen would’ve been trembling, but when you can burn the screen with the dialogues why would you wont use them."

4384,"Wild Honey dates from that post-Pet Sounds period (1967); in it, Brian Wilson has become less of a driving creative force (it's his first album since Surfin' USA in which he wasn't the sole producer), allowing his brother Carl to emerge as a kind of white soul brother in tracks like ""Darlin',"" ""How She Boogalooed It"" and an unexpected remake of Stevie Wonder's ""I Was Made to Love Her."" It's really, really slight, with 11 brief cuts spanning all of about 24 minutes. The whole thing frankly feels like a bit of a throwaway—but what an infectious throwaway it is! Ramshackle-sounding compared to the more technically immaculate Pet Sounds, yet endlessly charming especially in its integration of R&B elements, Wild Honey is an endlessly catchy blast of The Beach Boys' usual all-American innocence, which must have sounded defiantly retro amid the tumultuous '60s. But an understanding of the historical period surrounding this album isn't necessary for an appreciation of its relatively modest yet unforgettable splendors. (And could its slightness be deliberate? Maybe there's a reason the album ends with an a cappella ""Poof!"")"

4389,"Boys are monitored more closely than girls for the development of ‘appropriate’ personalities and interests, being called a ‘sissy’ has a negative value and is laced with contempt and derision. The term ‘sissy’ has feminine connotations and boys who get labelled with this term exhibit traits which boys have been taught to despise in men as they are ‘unnatural’ due to their supposedly innate femininity. These boys are thus threatened by the existence of ‘feminine’ boys and become insecure and try to prove their masculinity in the often cruel treatment of the boys who have been labelled ‘sissy’."

4400,"The card stock was an improvement on the paper thin 1981 release. It lacked the newness of the previous year, but held its own upon initial release. In hindsight, this year did nothing to topple the Topps monopoly. Topps had the better execution with design. Donruss was well ahead of Fleer in design and flash. 1982 Donruss looked like a second tier baseball card. That's exactly where they were at this point. Big things were on the horizon, but this was a nice stepping stone."
4401,"Following the GA's inability to reach consensus on this subject, those of us on both sides of the debate were tasked with further discussing the issue. Cynically, I found myself assuming the people we had been debating weren't actually committed enough to the process to enter into further conversation. However, immediately after the meeting, one guy came over to continue the discussion. Within a few moments, a group of a dozen people were talking about how power functions, how Latin@ folks are racially profiled as undocumented immigrants, the policing of trans folks (especially transwomen of color), the precariousness of service industry workers employment, and so much more. Here we were, mostly strangers, spending our Friday night standing in Duncan Plaza engaged in political debate."

The goal of all these CEO types is to achieve these ends. The downsizing and mechanisation of their work forces at the expense of jobs will be as much as modern technology allows, as much as is seen viable by the board and investors. It’s the nature of the (relatively) free market economy, it’s the nature of the beast. A ravenous, fickle, bloated beast left unshackled and untamed for far too long. The answer should be simple.

Use one to drain the mango syrup into (through a fine mesh sieve if you've got a big one, or through a pasta strainer or even a slotted spoon in a pinch) and the second to hold the drained mango pieces. Butter and flour an ~9-inch tart or pie pan (with a removable bottom, preferably), and roll the dough out to ~4 inches in diameter larger than your pan. (I always get lazy when I'm rolling dough out, but you want to roll it enough so it'll come up over the sides of the pan by at least an inch.) Drape the dough into the pan, gently tucking it down into the corners of the pan and letting the edges hang over the sides. Get your oven heating to 400 F."

Although there were other indigenous peoples living in parts of these territories, the Boers were accepted by them as another indigenous people and it is worthwhile to note that very few major clashes took place between the Boers and the Black peoples of this time. When such clashes did take place, they were usually over matters such as stock or grazing - at a time very normal matters for indigenous peoples to argue over."

I always find myself copying her without meaning too, but hopefully she finds it flattering...after all imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right? Well, first she got me obsessed with scarves. My wardrobe is somewhat basic, without a lot of patterns. I never understood how much pizazz a scarf can give a plain outfit! But now she has me addicted to nail polish. I have always had a love of makeup, but in the past I have never really made time for my nails. I think that is going to change! I just feel like anything you can do to make yourself feel pretty and boost your self-esteem is a good thing. I'm not saying that someone needs makeup and a manicure to be beautiful.

Even though he’s not real verbal yet, those things stick out for him and he readily copies. We worried early on in the adoption process about being matched with a boy, as we have gone on record as saying that it’s easier (and cooler) for a girl to have two dads than a boy. Just look at Rachel on “Glee” and how is she very vocal and sometimes very adamant about her parents and their sexuality. The slur “fag” is still the default taunt for playground harassment, and for a boy with two dads it’s open season, so naturally, we’re going to have to be aware of that as Eli gets older."

My three girls are going to read just about everything I write and so are my sisters, my nieces and nephews and maybe even a few of you, so am I going to write very Neeckkeed? Probably not. For my purposes, I don’t think I need to. I will let “Momma Lou” do all the really colorful language, but maybe I should shed a few layers and still be in line with what is called for."

4518,"Your obedience has been fulfilled, at least as far as you can tell. For weeks, or months, or perhaps even for years now you’ve pressed in and obeyed God. Whether in time or money or prayer or hope, you’ve invested greatly in the kingdom. So your bread was cast many days ago and now your hope is starting to fade. You lay awake at night and begin to wonder why. You’re now asking God all the hard questions like you’ve never asked before. You’re determined to find the right answers that will unlock each and every door. Obedience has left you standing there on the shore, waiting, simply waiting. When will your bread return to you? The words, “Father, Father why have you abandoned me?” are the only words that seem to come out."

Most religions focus on prayer to the heavens or other similar places and your outwardly deeds..very few concentrate on the inner self..”Pray, Pray, Pray..ask for forgiveness and Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, or Allah will take care of you”..this is nonsense and will not enhance your spiritual Awareness one iota..you personally have to take responsiblity for your own inner spiritual journey and as you do so through Trance, meaningful prayer,and any other spiritual disciplines,you begin to access the inner knowledge that is available to us. Being able to see beyond the conventional and into the worlds beyond is where the path lies, the journey is two-fold, firstly it is being able to reach the inner path, then it is about travelling the path,..the travelling of the path is the true journey."

Of course, the rest of us tried to help out, but the brunt of the coordination fell squarely on Shelly’s shoulders. Nathan endeared himself to the family by providing the best homemade venison and pork sausage, and fantastic grass-fed beef from his personal cow, in addition to his easy-going personality. We appreciated Louise protecting the environment by collecting all the recyclables after every meal, and for planning, with Mark, the next reunion in the Northeast. Scott regaled us with stories of his searches all over the world for WWII downed planes. We barely overlapped with Reid and Henrietta but were glad to see their smiling faces. Dan, Bryce and Nick showed up in the nick of time so we could hear stories of the Northwest settlers and tales of extreme humidity in H-Town. Steve and Karen, naturally, left with the minimum of time allotted for their drive to the San Antonio airport, Steve relying on his car racing background to achieve maximum efficiency within the limits of the law. We also remembered those not present, including those who couldn’t make the trip, and those who departed this earth prematurely. They were with us in spirit, and their memories live on in the Deaver clan, ever a part of the big Texas landscape."

4556,"Thanks to her vocal versatility, and with the help of Bradley’s direction and arrangements, Cline enjoyed both country and pop success. His arrangements incorporated strings and other instruments not typical of country recordings of the day. He considered Cline’s voice best-suited for country pop-crossover songs, and helped smooth her voice into the silky, torch song style for which she is famous. Nevertheless, she did not enjoy singing pop material. This new, more sophisticated instrumental style became known as The Nashville sound, created by Bradley and RCA’s Chet Atkins, who produced Jim Reeves, Connie Smith, and Eddy Arnold. Cline’s first Decca release was the country pop ballad, “I Fall to Pieces” (1961), written by Hank Cochran and Harlan Howard. The song was promoted at both country and pop music stations across the country, leading to success on both country and pop charts. The song slowly climbed to the top of the country chart—Cline’s first number one. The song also made No. 12 on the pop chart, as well as No. 6 on the adult contemporary chart, a major feat for any country singer at the time. The song made her a household name, demonstrating that a woman country singer could enjoy as much crossover success as a man."

4567,"I think my mom got there around 9:00, just as I was telling them that I couldn’t not push. It felt like forever waiting for them to take apart the bed and get the stirrups out and all, but it couldn’t have taken long. I was grateful but exhausted when it was time to start pushing, and I had that same feeling like they were all supposed to tell me what exactly to do and no one was telling me. I pushed and focused on not tensing up my face, but my legs were so weak all I could think was that there was no way I could do this. I knew I had hours ahead of me and I had only pushed a couple times and I was totally drained. But then they told me he was coming. I didn’t believe them. I guess that was the running theme for my labor experience. Even though I wanted so desperately to have a different birth experience than I’d had before, I didn’t really believe that I would. So when they told me he was coming, instead of thinking “Okay, I can do this” I was thinking ”Stop lying to me, I know I have to do this 100 more times and I don’t want to get my hopes up.”"
4568,"Speaking of graduation and music, I do want to bring out one more victory I had. My experiences bringing in my guitar this year led to an interesting request from some of my seniors: to play songs to go with the senior slide show that is shown at graduation. We worked out what songs I could do from a list of songs they wanted to have (some of them included because I played them in class), and I set out to arrange them. In order to record them well enough to be played at graduation, I enlisted the help of an English professor at my alma mater who has a small recording setup in his home, and in about 16 hours or so, we recorded 5 popular songs, all instruments played by yours truly. (That includes acoustic and electric guitars, piano, organ, synthesized drums, synthesized bass, synthesized strings, and vocals.) I’ll get to listen to them tomorrow evening at graduation, and I hope they go over well. If nothing else, it will be something rewarding to have left the senior class, and that’s worth a lot to me.

His artistic passion is so uncompromisingly beautiful that he disregards romantic relationships, base needs, social standing etc. He does whatever he wants. He tore up checks from Conde Naste because, “if they give you money, they own you.” He is an artistic aesthete I’ve never experienced in my life. He’s described by fashionistas and titans of the fashion industry as ‘the most important man in the world’. And yet, he’s this 90lb bag of bones and pixie-dust jam who doesn’t even stop hiding in the sidelines and snapping shots at his own awards show. No, he is not a man. He’s a demigod, a nymph displaced from the ancient forest to the urban millennium, drifting about civilization, observing and yet never disrupting. He does not review. He does not analyze. He simply watches. When told to differentiate street fashion as ‘in’ or ‘out’ he returned with the agonizingly egalitarian, and bewitchingly brilliant “if they’re wearing it, it’s ‘in’. Everything is ‘in’” (paraphrase, sorry). In no way does he create trends. He’s a cultural scientist of such blissful objectivity that he can simply observe. He does not partake in the slightest, never accepting so much as a glass of water at events and sporting a duct-taped poncho when it rains because, “why buy a new one? It’ll just rip in the same places.”"

4621,"The author of the letter to the Hebrews (whom we assume to be St. Paul), in urging us to enter into “The Father’s Rest” (that is, His Perfect will for us), reveals more explicitly the important role the Word of God plays in coming to such a discernment when he tells us that .. “Indeed, the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

That was more of a joke…budget or no budget, a dream project is one in which the client expresses their goals and wishes, and then listens to and takes the advice of the designer / professional. This is a profession where so much faith and trust is put into an individual that may or may not have something tangible to show them. The ability to be a good designer, however, isn’t in a piece of paper and can’t necessarily be taught, and so a great deal of understanding design and one’s ability can be as simple as this…Some people have it and some people don’t."

One non-science friend was surprised about the middle-class wages. “Why would you spend so much time, effort, and money for a degree where you may only earn $40,000? Shouldn’t you be making six-figures?” I replied that they don’t do it for the money, they do it because we love it. Huzzah for pursuing passions!"

Unfortunately he missed the more correct meaning of the ancient Israelite festival as he viewed the text through the lens of the penal substitutionary atonement model. even more unfortunate, this position obscured and missed the truths found in Leviticus concerning the character of God and his dealings with his people. Such truths illuminate the importance of the crucifixion, helping us better understand certain aspects of atonement in the New Testament writings."

Although it was based on a romantic melodrama written by the dramatist Ernst Raupach, it contains enough supernatural elements to be included here. The plot concerns a poor miller's son who wants to wed a rich miller's daughter, but her father is vocally against the romance. A dramatic turn of events sees the death of the girl and her father, both of which are foreshadowed by the appearances of the bird of death and a ghost appearing in a gothic graveyard. Interestingly, the same production company (Kolm/Fleck) had made the same movie the previous year, but none of that footage is believed to have survived."

4646,"After many grueling hours of researching life insurance companies and comparing quotes, you submit your application only to be told that you are not eligible for coverage. While you probably have an opinion about whether or not this decision was fair, the best thing you can do is to get a second quote. No two insurance companies follow the same underwriting policies and their guidelines are never truly set in stone. Learn from the decision and find another company and agent who are willing to offer you decent coverage at a reasonable price."

4654,"This whole dinner took me less than 10 minutes to prep and was great because my daughter could help with each step. She loves to sprinkle the cheese and stir the eggs. By using whole eggs and egg whites you can really cut down on the fat and cholesterol without sacrificing any of the taste. I used 2 % milk which made it taste pretty rich, but you could use skim milk if you wanted. If you want to splurge, whole milk would be delicious. One of the things I like most about this is that this meal has something from all the food groups making it not only tasty and satisfying, but healthy too. It doesn’t get much better than this. You could also mix in any veggies you wanted and could top this with sour cream, salsa and even some fresh cilantro."

Since pool chemicals are not designed for human consumption this is not normally an issue. I have many of the same warning I gave in the first article about pool chemicals and drinking water. Even if the active ingredient is necessary for disinfection, the lower grade of chemical, usually around 30%, means that 70% of what you are adding to the water is unknown. That lack of information is and should be unsettling. Again ANSI/NSF 60 is the standard for drinking water chemicals, you can order this grade for your pool. The hypochlorite I use in my water treatment plant has pool instructions printed on the containers. If you are a prepper and have a pool I highly recommend drinking water quality disinfectants. You will always have a fresh supply, and none of the worries with poisonous chemicals when you are dying of thirst and you have 10,000 gallons in your back yard."

He finds himself immediately attracted to the feminist Britta (Choke‘s Gillian Jacobs) in his Spanish class (taught by The Hangover‘s Ken Jeong). Jeff founds a Spanish study group to at first get closer to Britta, but he eventually strikes up an unexpected friendship as the leader of a group of ragtag misfits all trying to survive the surreal landscape that is Greendale. With a group consisting of the Asperger’s suffering pop-culture fanatic Abed (Danny Pudi), the former jock and sensitive idiot Troy (Donald Glover), the racist, homophobic, and obnoxious Pierce (Chevy Chase), the virginal and shy ex-Ritalin addict Annie (Mad Men‘s Alison Brie), and the single black mother Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), there’s bound to be conflict and personal crisis, but when they learn to stick together and care for each other, this study group becomes its own little family."

4684,"As we advanced through the savannah, Ewoudt, the primary ranger, motioned us to stop and be still. Our eyes scanned the bushveld. Somewhere, lurking amidst the khaki and the gold was something large and grey. An elephant? No – the beast that lumbered into view was the archetypal armoured tank, a white rhino. Huge beast. Short-sighted and not at all keen on humans. We crept forward as the beast hulked between the bushes. We were downwind of him so he could smell us, if not see us. His twitchy little ears waggled back and forth and he looked increasingly unsettled. Then with a mighty snort he was off, moving with remarkable grace for one so huge (males weigh between 2040 – 2260 kgs) and disappeared down a hill."

4687,"Exploring possibilities, to my mind, is what learning is all about. Playing is often defined as engaging in some (idle) activity for pleasurable purposes rather than serious ones. That is, playing for serious purposes seems to be a contradiction in terms – though one wonders what to make of the “playing” in golf and bridge tournaments, or of playing video games for a living. Add to that the idea that learning is a serious endeavour, which should be seriously managed by serious policy-makers, and we end up with the conviction that learning must be achieved through boring activities, because achievement takes 99 parts transpiration to one part inspiration, and where there’s no pain there’s no gain, that sort of thing. Children’s spontaneous learning tells us a different story: it is precisely because learning is such a serious activity that play plays such an important role in it."

However, his views were changed once again by the bravery of those men of color who chose to fight for their own freedom. After the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first regiment of black troops to fight in the war, showed courage in the face of fire at Battery Wagner in South Carolina, nearly 200,000 African Americans would sign up in order to fight for their own freedom. After this, the colonization idea was scrapped, and Lincoln credited the men of color with helping to turn the tide of the Civil War."

He’s given me good gifts over and above reconciliation with Himself: He’s given me Caruso to listen to, iced tea to drink, a laptop to use, a book about the General Epistles to read for class, a Bible in my language, a wireless mouse, friends who call me up to go to concerts at the last minute, a cell phone that works, a love for old movies. And reconciliation to Him is more than I could’ve hoped for. How much more are the every day graces simply, in one sense, icing on the cake? But also, in another sense, how could such good gifts only be icing? I don’t think they are. They’re far more nourishing to the soul when served with the delicious dish of reconciliation to the Father."

4716,"It’s rarely remembered these days that until quite recently, scientific research was mostly carried on by amateurs. The word “scientist” wasn’t even coined until 1833; before then, and for some time after, the research programs that set modern science on its way were carried out by university professors in other disciplines, middle class individuals with spare time on their hands, and wealthy dilletantes for whom science was a more interesting hobby than horse racing or politics. Isaac Newton, for example, taught mathematics at Cambridge; Gilbert White founded the science of ecology with his Natural History of Selborne in his spare time as a clergyman; Charles Darwin came from a family with a share of the Wedgwood pottery fortune, had a clergyman’s education, and paid his own way around the world on the H.M.S.

If the guy with that nasty cold going around ran around groaning and saying ‘cold…cooooold…COOOOOOLD,’ would you shake his hand? Of course not. The ability for the disease to transmit itself would be immediately and instantly curtailed. No zombie would be able to get on a plane, drive a car, sail a boat, which means the simple geography of the earth would keep them bottled up in one tight area, even *presuming* they were able to spread the disease with ease, which they can’t. Even if somebody were to manifest as a zombie on a plane, they would be quickly restrained and those one or two people they bit would be quarantined/checked out. Somebody bitten by a rabid person doesn’t just get to walk away, folks. Hell, they don’t *want* to walk away–they want antisceptic, bandages, and a consultation with a doctor."

4750,"If they have fallen into one of these traps, or any others for that matter, they need to make some conscious changes to the way they operate.

4771,"First, Smulders is perfectly fine as Maria Hill. Second, the role of Maria Hill in AVENGERS is to serve as Fury’s right hand woman on the Helicarrier, an equivalent to Agent Coulson’s role out in the real world. Hill basically exists because there’s a few scenes where the film needs someone from SHIELD to do something, so why not have it all be the same person? And if they’re all going to be the same person, why not have it be Maria Hill? And if it’s going to be Hill, why not have it be Cobie Smulders? It all works for me."

This process is fully organic and results in the creation of our spirit, or more precisely, our spiritual bodies. In other words, the spiritual organs of this rarefied body form in a way that is perfectly analogous to the ideas, affections and constituents of our belief systems. It is formed according to who we really are. That is why we can seek and digest information that favors our opinions as a real “food” to maintain our inner lives."
4778,"Although Blazers executives would not say this is the end of the Oden era, the chances Oden plays again in Portland, or anywhere in the NBA, are doubtful at best. Of his five knee surgeries, three of them have been microfracture procedures, including Monday's surgery in Vail, Colo. Microfracture is the most invasive and serious of knee procedures, and involves making tiny fractures in the knee bone to generate bleeding and stimulate new cartilage growth. No NBA player has come back to play after undergoing three microfracture surgeries."

We have been endowed with all the faculties (e.g. rationality) it takes to make sense and find meaning in a world we are, ultimately, not the authors of. And it is precisely those faculties that have impregnated history again; ready to foster the future the West must now bear…in order for the Truth to be."

Somehow or other, though, he managed to get enough doubt into my head during what little conversation there was. He didn’t know why I was so pissed off about a rape. His response to my rage didn’t quite fit. It perplexed me enough that I confronted Nutjob about this. After a few minutes, she confessed – she cheated on me with Asshole."

Instead, the aging ghul hunter receives a desperate message from his unrequited love, Miri Almoussa, who begs him to look into the murder of her niece and her husband, indicating that ""it was neither man nor animal that killed them."" Though stung by the fact that Miri did not come to make her request of him in person, Adoulla nevertheless agrees to go on one, last adventure for her sake. He and Raseed then set off to investigate this tragedy, in the process meeting the novel's third protagonist, Zamia Badawi, the last of her band and gifted by God with lion-shape. Together, these three characters attempt to solve not only the mystery of the death of Miri's niece but also a greater mystery that threatens the political stability of Dhamsawaat."
4808,"The social self is also one of the main vehicles of magic. I wrote two weeks ago about the extent to which human social interactions are mediated by nonverbal and nonrational communication—body language, gesture, vocal tone, facial expression, and all the other communicative methods we have in common with our mammal relatives. These are the channels of communication through which people fall in love, make friends and enemies, establish their place in social hierarchies, claim a larger or smaller share of whatever resources are to hand: all the things that baboons and beavers and the rest of our nonhuman kin do with comparable signals sent through comparable channels. Baby baboons and beavers pick up facility in this language in their early years, and no doubt absorb all kinds of lessons about their social and physical environment through the same means; so do we."

However, this figure is based on a misinterpretation of a 1987 Canadian study in Newfoundland, which found that, between 1981 and 1984, more than 100,000 marine mammals, including birds, were killed by discarded nets. The Canadian study did not mention plastic bags."

4828,"I have to say £3 rather sticks in my craw and makes me think whether I should have a half or a pint less than I really wanted. I also have to question whether I can justify paying that, or nearly that, in a Robinson’s or a pub company pub, when in the local area I can be paying £2.15 for Holts, £1.99 in Spoons or a mere £1.60 for Sam Smith’s.

Over the 127 hours that he is trapped he used his camcorder to keep a video diary. As he realizes his efforts to chip away at the boulder are futile, he begins to attempt to cut into his arm, but finds his knife too dull to break his skin. He then stabs his arm, but realizes he will not be able to cut through the bone. He finds himself out of water and is forced to drink his own urine. His video logs become more and more desperate as he feels himself dying. He begins dreaming about relationships and past experiences."
4830,"When Josh was first diagnosed (and back when we thought that his visual impairment issues would be his primary disability) we went to another doctor, who practiced at a hospital closest to us. This doctor did not have a very good ""bedside manner"". She exuded very little patience with actual people and a lot of fascination with ""cases"". I felt like she never actually looked at me. It was a strange experience of going to an eye doctor and not being seen. She was one of those people that made you wonder why certain people go into pediatrics. She was so clearly not a kid/ baby person. She wasn't great with stressed out parents either. Maybe she felt like little kid eyes would be more challenging to deal with? During our second visit with her, Joshua (who had really bad reflux at that time) threw up all over her and me in a massive fountain or semidigested formula. It was our last visit with this particular doctor."

I also learned that boys never hit girls, but they always defend their sisters. This became quite a dilemma when the neighbourhood bully turned out to be the girl across the street and my next younger sister turned out to be physically and athletically more gifted than me."
4835,"You’re looking at the house my great-grandparents moved into in the early 1920s after they got married. They were immigrants from backwater towns in Calabria, in southern Italy, and they, like a lot of immigrants from their immediate vicinity, moved to the rust belt town of Kenosha, Wisconsin. You’ve probably heard its name but don’t know much about it. Nestled on the Lake Michigan coastline, Kenosha is equidistant from Milwaukee and Chicago. It’s the birthplace of minor celebrities such as actors Al Molinaro, Mark Ruffalo, and Don Ameche, and one major one, Orson Welles. In its day, Kenosha was a typical industrial port, churning out automobiles at Nash Motors, undergarments at Jockey, and brass rods and bars at American Brass, which was where my great-grandfather, Anthony Tenuta, worked. I don’t know exactly when they moved in to this house on 24th Avenue, just a few blocks from Columbus Park, but it was probably around 1921 or 1922 (it was known as Newell Street back then). The house is for sale now, and like Kenosha, it’s seen better days. Remarkably, once it’s sold, it will mark the end of a roughly 90-year period that it was in the Tenuta family."

4838,"For the Stoics, the world is a place full of chains of cause and effect that play out in ways we often cannot understand or change. The only thing one can change is one’s response to the things the world presents to us. It makes little sense to mourn or worry about what one cannot change, cannot have foreseen, or could not have done differently based on what one knew at the time. What one can control is one’s response, right now, a situation that is perpetually renewed. And if one is to respond well, one’s mind cannot be clouded by worries, fears, regrets, and guilt that can cloud our judgment. Rather, we need a clear mind, and this is only achieved by focusing on the present and its demands, so that we can act well now, because that is what will most impact what happens afterwards in our own sphere of influence on the world."

The patient says to me ""I'd like to see more of you and less of her (Nurse Crappy)"". What I wanted to say - ""Well, we can stop the epidural and I will spend lots more time in here with you, but in the meantime I have a patient going natural who I am spending my time with."" In reality I just smiled and told her I would try to get her another nurse. Which didn't happen as the board was full and everyone was loaded up."

4844,"to them. These tended to be low paying jobs and there was a demand for subsistence housing. The land in what today is Hell’s Kitchen was significantly owned by John Jacob Astor and his descendants who had relatively recently purchased it for development. As was the practice of the Astor family, the land was leased on long-term ground lease to developers who erected old law tenements whose purpose was to squeeze as many families as possible on to the plot. As a result, the area gained a reputation as a dilapidated slum for the immigrant poor. However, it did house a significant number of predominantly Irish and German families, many of whom moved up from even worse conditions in the five points area near Foley Square. In addition a number of the Gangs from the five points also formed in the area."

4860,"This year Halloween was great! I really enjoyed the night as we walked around the neighborhood with friends and our family, the kids going to doors we would never approach otherwise. The people handing out candy were friendly, the kids often said trick-or-treat in unison and even said thank you most of the time. The older kids helped the younger kids without being asked. And I now firmly feel that you are never too old to trick-or-treat. I even dressed up, instead of just putting on our hat w/ ogre horns and calling it my costume. We arrived home tired but content. The kids dumped out their candy for sorting and trading, while the men caught a bit of the football game on TV."

4863,"Back to reality. I hope that what I felt with Alex was real. That it wasn't the keys or the bridge enhancing our enjoyment of one another's company but an honest to goodness spark. One can never be to sure, especially with ketchup. The tricky thing about dating is that no matter how much you like someone, no matter how many butterflies erupt in your stomach when you see them, no matter how much you really want it to work, it's not up to you; they need to feel it as well. As I'm somewhat of a control freak (I have planned all my dates for the entire summer after all) I'm used to knowing where I stand in the moment and what the next step will be. It's something I'm trying to change and I'm getting better. Step by step, key by key, I'm trying to sit back and enjoy. Even if it brings me to a broken lock, it will have been worth seeing the view."
4864,"Other stories have placed identity loss in the foreground. How often we talk about the loss of identity as being an effect of disability! Yet, the absence of crucial information about identity may itself be a Disability. Take, for instance, persons who are of First Nations (Native American) descent, but are cut off from their ancestral roots. This is a surprisingly common experience created by some of the same forces that marginalize persons who are traditionally disabled, including marginalization, colonialism, and enclosure. The overall effect of separation from one’s tribal roots is frequently to instill a sense of lost identity, and a haunting sense of one’s Self as incomplete. Efforts to regain tribal identity may be rebuffed by the tribe of origin for any number of reasons, although most of those relate to the protection of limited resources, and, oddly enough, tribal identity. The effect, however, is to reinforce the seeker’s sense of loss and alienation."

4870,"Lonergan and Lenczewski's transition shots are almost uniformly masterful. This is where much of the film's real alchemy lies, I suspect. A shot of high school boys ogling a female gym teacher cuts to a scene between Lisa and her own teacher-crush, Mr. Aaron (Matt Damon). A late-night mother-daughter conversation is preceded by an exterior view of the family apartment, where it's possible to see through a nearby frosted window that the Cohens' neighbors are up and active at the witching hour too. Typing out descriptions seems to rob these transitions of their power; they seem more banal or heavy-handed than they appear when occurring on screen. But I think they're one of Lonergan's key techniques in constructing a world and our sense of Lisa's place in it. Movies usually show us how an individual might react to love, lust, fear, pain, death, etc. Margaret shows us that, and also gives us glimpses of evidence that everyone in the world is reacting to the same forces all the time. I can't take seriously the critiques of the film which consider unnecessary the Manhattan cityscapes Lonergan and his editors frequently use as transitions between scenes with dialogue."

I can’t promise there isn’t a single unique-to-catholics sentence anywhere in there, but none come to mind. Might make a nice discussion tool for that awkward silence when you aren’t sure what you have in common with your catholic (protestant) friend. The answer is: All this.

Professionally manufactured wind turbines of the right scale are a good start, and those green wizards in training who have the money and lack the fairly modest technical skills to build their own could do worse than to buy and install one. Still, there’s also a huge role here for the homebuilt turbine, and for those individuals whose willingness to get to work shaping turbine blades and bolting together octet truss towers might, as things unfold, lead to a future career."

4887,For this attempt at a table beer I decided to use millet as my adjunct grain. When I was looking for exotic grains this was the only thing that I could find easily. Ive had millet a few times at ethnic restaurants and I wasn't really ever that impressed. It was always a slightly nutty mush pile that in my opinion need a bit of texture to make it worth eating. Somehow though I have a feeling that it will work in beer much better though. To try and help that along I decided to pan toast the millet until became fragrant and started popping. I'm hoping this will help to bring out the nutty flavors in the beer. Strangely thought toasting the millet didn't result in much color development.

4890,"Le Guin’s exploration of a genderless society while writing in the late 1960s is an excellent piece of feminist literature. However, these explorations are subtle and not didactic. While it’s often argued that The Left Hand of Darkness is not Le Guin’s most lyrical writing, this subtle style is distinct and left me with the feeling of ‘they don’t write ‘em like they used to’ – and this is a good thing. There is a strange duality where the Envoy comes from the more utopic society, yet the genderless society of Winter has its own sense of utopia. The sense of it all is hope – hope for the future. Wrapped up in this is the equally interesting presentation of a Cold War between two nations on the planet of Winter, a Cold War on a planet where true war is unknown. Themes run deeper than feminism, hope, and the balance of superpowers and I encourage you to follow that link above to learn more."

When Heidi Hayes Jacobs emphatically shared that we should feel uncomfortable, I wondered, feeling a bit like the child in class who has just gotten the “wrong” answer. Now please don’t misunderstand, I was riveted by Heidi Hayes Jacobs’ presentation. My mind raced with her notion of “strategic upgrade”; not adding to our already overfull plates but shifting learning experiences strategically to more effectively meet the needs of our students today who are processing information differently, in more social, non-linear ways. I was feeling engaged, open, reflective, and interested. I was considering possibilities , reflecting on how better we might serve our students. I was learning and I was loving the opportunity."

At around 8:00 a.m. I was feeling hungry again and was due for a snack so I decided to have an egg on an English muffin because this was in a list of acceptable foods in the eating out guide. I made sure they didn't put any liquid margarine on the muffin. This held me over for a little while and I didn't feel too bad about the decision. But then I was in the room, watching boring video after boring video, positively crashing because I was running off of about four hours of sleep (did I mention I've had approximately ten hours total in the last three days?). I needed something to help me stay awake. And they had brought in a big bowl of candy for us to snack on... I'd been good about resisting, but I finally gave in and had a fun size Twizzler, a fun size Snickers, and a fun size Kit Kat. Stupid me. Felt bad about that decision afterward for sure. But, the sugar rush did make it so I stayed awake."

It is also full of trees furnished with flowers and fruits, and with crops of diverse kinds and other wealth. And it is surrounded on all sides with the salt ocean. As a person can see his own face in a mirror, even so is the island called Sudarsana seen in the lunar disc. Two of its parts seem to be a peepul tree, while two others look like a large hare.

The bacon may seem like overkill to those who don't worship at that shrine (I can't envision a food that can't be made better with bacon). I did find, however, that the cooking time was way off and I believe the dish can be made simpler still by using a mandolin to slice the potatoes very thinly and omitting the parboiling, which I intend to do next time. Therefore, I'm editing the instructions to reflect this. Otherwise, you want to try this dish very soon."
4960,"Nope, Ross is as good as ever, yet something has changed, and not for the better. Ross relies on his audience to provide him with the raw material for his act, but in the last couple of years a worrying trend has started. People (and for people read 'wacky student types') seem to have decided it's not good enough for Ross to get his comedy from unsuspecting subjects (couples arriving late, the woman in the front rows lovely scarf etc), and they now wants to be the 'stars' of the show. We've seen a marked rise in youngsters in the front few rows sporting stupid hats, knowing full well Ross won't be able to resist the bait. But the ridiculing of someone who wants to be ridiculed somehow is no longer fun. By far the most annoying trend has started during the half-time interval, where armies of wacky ones leave all manner of shite on the stage; funny notes (I use the word ‘funny’ in the loosest possible way), crappy homemade T-shirts, pieces of popcorn, sweets, you name it – whatever it is, they all have the same thing in common, they ain't funny. But like a junkie walking out to see 30 lines of coke set up for his pleasure, Ross can't help himself, and will always make a beeline for this tat. Tonight was the worst I’ve ever seen, the stage was covered, and it took him just over 45 minutes of the second half to work his way through all the rubbish that had been left there. The truth is, it's funny for one or two people in the audience (i.e. the twats who put it there), for everyone else it’s boring. How funny is someone's bus pass going to be for an audience of 1500 people? Of course the owner of the bus pass goes home feeling like ‘Charlie Big Potatoes’, thinking (wrongly) he was the star of the show."

5003,"Please excuse the upcoming half-week delay in new posts. An upcoming thermodynamics exam is hitting the grad student/blog author hard, so things have been pushed back. As a brief preview for what is getting pushed back: we’ve got another installment in the quasi-feature Indie 101 on the way, and a bit of opinion on the hilariously poor Columbus Blue Jackets season (fair warning: I am a Columbus fan so they’ll get more than a bit of attention on this blog)."
5004,"She set her mobile dutifully to ‘silent’ and trotted out to tread the sticky pavements with her paramour, mindful of the damp in the air, the frizz it would make of her hair, “To catch a husband is an art; to hold him is a job,” she told herself for the look on his face, determined beneath the erroneously jaunty angle of the beret, was enough to prompt her to a wiser silence."

5006,"I checked the notes. She had come in with an MSQ score of something like 3 out of 10, which meant she was quite disorientated. I ran the questions again. I asked her who the Prime Minister was and she said ‘Mr Fisher, no, Mr Hughes’. I asked her the year and she said 1915. On the MSQ that’s a simple 0 out of 2, but the answers were consistent. I asked her how old she was. She said she thought she was 12. She was certain she was not more than 14, but said that if it was 1915 she was 12. 0 from 3 but, had it been 1915, 3 from 3."

I vaguely remember the vast grounds and my beautiful regal bedroom with a four poster bed. Every morning I was woken up by the sound of bells around the cows necks on the way for milking. I often wonder what happened with the castle. I have never returned to Ireland since that trip. One day I hope to visit Dublin and taste their potatoes again"
5010,"I have been lucky enough to take two different workshops in August. Since I was a self taught feltmaker in the beginning, it was only through the Northeast Feltmakers Guild that I had had any real instruction. I took my first official (ie paid for) class two years ago with Linda Veilleux and the next summer I spent a week at Shakerag in India Flint's Quiltfelt Landskin class. Having two back to back workshops this year was a big deal for me. Especially as the first one was at the Felter's Fling. I had decided that if this was going to be the last year that Sharon Costello was going to run the Fling I was going to go whether I could really afford it or not. Because I have been teaching I decided that it was important for me to take workshops myself. Teaching has also given me some extra funds to reinvest in my feltmaking."

Last Saturday the repairman called and said he'd be by this morning. He hasn't arrived yet. We all have air conditioning in our bedrooms so sleeping's no problem but boy it's hot in that room during the day! You might just as well spend your time on the balcony.

So real does he appear that tourists have even gone up to ask him questions; he politely refers them to the “nice ladies” inside the museum – ladies who have no idea who he is and can find no trace of him when they rush outside to see who the tourists are talking about. In the annex building, which houses an extensive collection of memorabilia on the second floor, heavy footsteps have been heard upstairs when no one is there, and the presence of a man believed to be a Confederate Major lurks in the downstairs office."
5026,"A writer’s life comes with its fair share of frustrations and a lot of struggle, that’s why it becomes important for writers until they make it big to cling on to their day jobs or atleast have a part time job.

5033,Originally I was going to cover the chair in purple fur for Katelyn to have as a reading chair in her room but not that she and Drew share a room there isn't enough space. The only fabric that I could find that I even liked the pattern and the color ended up being a set of sheets from Walmart (Better Homes and Gardens) and it was a huge cost savings. So much cheaper to buy twin sheets then that same amount of material off the bolt.

5044,"Even if the flute gets the spotlight for most of the time, TAAB2 is still a progressive rock album at its core. The songs are very well glued together, complex and intricate. Overshadowed by the flute as they might be, the guitars still sound pretty bad ass and the drumming is top notch. Because Ian’s voice is not as good as it was in his youth, he turned to a more mellow, low tone pitched delivery and, frankly, that’s a good thing; it blends very well with the album, and it proves that Ian is the kind of artist that is very aware of his limits and writes his songs accordingly. He hasn’t turned soft, if that’s what you’re thinking, nor has his music suffered a decline in quality – it’s just a tad different from what he used to do and it suits him well."

So I will keep it brief and short...For over a year and half my Papa had been fighting to live after a massive stroke. Through his struggle he managed to keep his humor and inspire so many. He is why I push harder and set goals beyond what I ever imagined. Papa was the last grandparent I had, and the first I ever met. Living across the street, my sister and my cousins and I were there everyday. He taught me to always do the right thing and feed your mind...The service was beautiful...so many stories and so many friends and family who have come to be with us during Shivah (time of mourning)"
5048,"But the truth is that not everybody in Hazleton likes what Maddon is trying to do. After all, he doesn't live here any more. He doesn't understand what day-to-day life is like here. He is a famous baseball manager now who deals with famous baseball manager things. There are some in town who feel like he is lecturing them, others who think he is well-meaning but unrealistic.

I then had the task of finding someone to sell them all for me as I surely didn’t want to deal with strangers coming to my home, didn’t really know the value on each gun, etc. This caused me to search for receipts which Rob had quite the habit of getting rid of so I wouldn’t know what he’d spent.

Somehow, though, the shapes conspired together to form a spiral of such perfect natural grace that the eye was sucked along it, round and round and unmistakably upward into darkness.

The moment a supernatural representative of the force of evil turns up, it means there is hope again. If supernatural evil exists, then supernatural good must also exist, which means God exists, which means Heaven exists. Just one demon, however small, just one, and the afterlife is back on the agenda! So when an innocent character in a horror book or film is confronted with a genuine demon, he or she should fall to their knees and cry, “Thank you, thank you! You're my ticket to Heaven! I do have a soul after all. No eternal oblivion for me! The afterlife, here I come!”"

5102,It certainly surprised the vicar at her christening when I handed her over and instead of a squishly little baby he encountered the huge plastic splint.

So if a man tells you that he's addicted to pornography, it also means that he fantasizes and that he masturbates. It's gross to think about it, I know, but it's true."

I am super happy with the way things worked out: I definitely need to sand off the rough edges, but this is much closer to the original book I had in mind in terms of themes, worldbuilding, and voice.

5117,"If the movie had this effect on me it must be devastating for parents. I can’t imagine what it feels like for a mother, or for anyone for that matter, to watch a psychopath in the making – all those signs, no matter what anyone does or says. It seems that it cannot be stopped. Kevin’s eyes –throughout all the different ages – creeped me out. A human being without feelings, someone who is capable of being so mean. During those two hours I caught myself holding my breath dozens of times; all that noise, all that red – it makes you uncomfortable, suffocated. You feel the mother’s desperation and fear, the father being such an idiot makes you angry. The minute I saw the little girl with a patch over her eye I knew her brother had had something to do with it – the more you see of him the more evil you expect. As the film goes one, in a non-linear way, Eva’s feelings – of course her name would have to be Eva – became my feelings, all the guilt she carries with her. The brief dialogue and the hug in the final scene felt like a punch in the stomach. I don’t like to play the gender card but in this case I strongly believe that being directed by a woman made this movie what it is – looking forward to seeing more of Lynne Ramsay’s work; to me, she deserved the nomination more than Alexander Payne or Woody Allen this year."

Eve Torres made it known that Beth Phoenix was not medically cleared to wrestle (something that our very own Mr. Quinn Gammon knew via text message from the WWE forty minutes prior to that actual conversation taking place).
5276,"8. He starts working on the taxes on Saturday, April 14, and discovers he doesn't have the basis information for the stock sale, which is really important information, because we did not make $15 a share on that stock! We made maybe 75 cents a share. We do not want to pay taxes on $15 a share. So he has to tear apart his office looking for the documents with the purchase price of the stock."

5278,"From the Mercato, we will take a short walk to Piazza Santa Maria Novella, dominated by the homonymous church, and once serving as the track for the Palio dei Cocchi, chariot races, organized by Cosimo I. The church of Santa Maria Novella is the home of the Dominicans. The lower half of the façade is in Romanesque style and was started in the 1300s. Leon Battista Alberti finished the façade, adding a classically inspired Renaissance top that created a Cartesian plane of perfect geometry."

5289,"The opportunity was one that I just stumbled upon. I was talking to some of the Irish Dance mom's on St. Patrick's day and my friend, Leah, commented about how moved she was by my sister's story on my blog. One of the mom's, Janine, wanted to know the story so I gave a brief explanation. She then said would you come speak for me. I was a little taken aback, because I had never thought I could speak. This is just my low self esteem on speaking or acting in the public. I thought about and said sure I think I could do this. She explained that she teaches a mandatory class for our county for 1st DUI offenders. Of course we all know that these are probably not really 1st time offenders, just 1st time caught..."

5308,"I didn't take any photos of her when they were singing as I couldn't see her very well. But when all the performers came back onstage later on, to do their body percussion piece, I was able to snap this happy, smiley shot. The body percussion item was simply called ""Rain"" and the students used their hands and feet to create a sound like a rainstorm, right from the first whispers of the wind (rubbing their hands together) to the opening sprinkles (clicking their fingers) and on to the heavier rain (slapping their thighs). In the middle of the downpour there was some startling sharp foot stamping which, combined with the lights being flicked on and off, looked and sounded just like thunder and lightening."

5310,"I've been known to have a pop at people or organisations that fail my World View. Perhaps too often it might be said. Just occasionally there is a complete reversal of that irritation almost to a level that makes me feel quite humble and sorry to have ever made the fuss in the first place. Of course, I'd like to think that it was my complaint that caused an apparent change of direction, but I guess I'm probably just too insignificant to make such a claim."

So for now, the ramblings, the noises of the past, the sound-track to my life, are just not making the cut!

5327,"To be honest, Chronicle should never have been as good as it was. It was sort of a trend film, blending in the popular found footage genre with the extremely popular superhero movie. What separates Chronicle from what it should have been is its focus on the people doing the filming and not the powers on display. Chronicle is a fascinating exercise in strong character development. The strong connection that the movie establishes with characters and the audience helps to provide a powerful and emotionally devastating experience. If you love both the found footage and superhero genres, then there is no reason you won’t love this film. It exploits the very best of the two genres while also telling the tragic story of a boy pushed too far."

Brilliant. Let's take a leaf from them and then kill them. The association of anti-Islamism--the noblest form of liberal anti-totalitarianism--with gay-bashing rednecks in the grip of a psychosexual panic was not just one of those linguistic accidents of history, in other words. These guys were sitting there in Virginia and really thinking about the best way to exploit the weaknesses of the Western psyche. They came up with this word--and admit it, it's clever; I challenge you to find a better one if you want to yank the West's chain--and they marketed it with petrodollars, and now it truly does drive public discourse and policy the world over. I was asked when I was recently on a Turkish television news show whether the Tea Party was ""Islamophobic."" That's what they're hearing here in Turkey, thanks to the IIIT. It's not an indigenous Turkish concept, I assure you...."

5348,"We have been kept in check by a cocktail of debt and aspiration. Both are related and are products of each other but are effective in keeping us from rocking the boat because we are scared. We aspire to be better off, to move up the social ladder, to be influential & etc. Debt is a symptom of this. We aspire to things we can’t afford so get in debt, debt that we aspire to pay off. Because we are saddled with this debt all we look to is the next pay-day, the next bonus or promotion. This cycle has been propagated by business and the free market – it is a cycle that has failed us and a system that we are now bailing out. But for what? So it can begin again."

5353,"The lowlights on The English Riviera are thankfully rare. Trouble’s tart vocals head wistfully into a swaying doo-wop beat, with typically smart lyrics such as the cute tautology of ""There’s a tear in your eye / And there’s no ‘I’ in tear"". And that brings it back to the familiar; Mount’s strengths as a songwriter come from his willingness to show off, however much he may be aware of this."
5354,"What she writes is true, from whatever side (student or professor/lecturer/et al.). I’d teach this craziness, even though I had my own doubts about it, and smile at students who challenged me. Happily. I wanted the rigor of independent thinking, the challenging of pat (too pat) ideas and ideology. I wanted my students to think for themselves.

All the major players are here for this council-discussion: Peter, Paul, James, Barnabas. The question: should Gentile converts also be required to undergo circumcision?"
5358,"I go outside and start the car to warm it up. I have a rental car currently since my car is in the body shop (See December Blog ""The Lottery.""), and the rental car company decides to give me a hulking tank of a car that doesn't even fit in my garage, so it sits on my tundra of a driveway. I cannot conceive of driving this monstrosity every day. I am stuck with it."
5359,"This last one is one that I find people under utilize in storyboarding, to be honest. If you ever find yourself storyboarding a sequence (or animating one, for that matter) and the viewer isn't quite connecting with the character, and isn't totally clear on what's going on inside the character's mind - what they are feeling and thinking - maybe you're not using the shifts in Squash and Stretch properly to clue the viewer in to what emotional changes the character is going through."

And, not understanding, many reject this Gift of Eternal Life and Reconciliation with God, thinking instead that it is only through our own merits and suffering that full atonement for our sins can be realized. But the Grace of God and His Love will not be frustrated by mankind’s blindness, rather His magnificent Love desires that those who receive the Blessing of Salvation carry on the Ministry of Christ so that all Humanity has the opportunity to hear and receive the Good News of the Kingdom of His Love!"

Hence the hunter's very ascetic conceptions of material welfare: an interest only in minimal equipment, ""if that; a valuation of smaller things over bigger; a disinterest in acquiring two or more of most goods; and the like. Ecological pressure assumes a rare form of concreteness when it has to be shouldered. If the gross product is trimmed down in comparison with other economies, it is not the hunter's productivity"
5367,"That's what Jonathan Demme captures perfectly in this light comic wheelie around the outskirts of Femme Fatale City. All it takes is one half-assed display of rebellion — skipping out on his lunch check — for Charlie (Jeff Daniels) to get picked up by Melanie Griffith's kitten-voiced wet dream Audrey. She practically kidnaps him from his day job and, as she's tossing the baggage of his white-collar life out the window of her car with a bottle of Seven Crown glued to her lips, you're wondering along with Charlie: just how far is her attention-whore-passing-as-free-spirit thing gonna go? Well, first, she sharpens Charlie's skills in the art of lying — how to bullshit one's boss while handcuffed to a motel bed, how to escape an Italian restaurant with an angry cook at your heels. Then, she tosses her new pupil into the deep end: she takes him home to Mom and passes him off as her husband."

But, today we took it to get resized and unfortunately, my fingers are so small they don’t even stock the ring size in the country. It will need to be specially made and could take up to 6 weeks. I’m pretty gutted that I won’t get to flash it to everyone just yet, but I’m sure I will make up for it when it arrives!"

5374,"From the findings of Lam’s report, it is clear that students (61.2%) think sex education is necessary and desire a change in the sex education curriculum to include issues related to self-development. The most interesting topic for students’ inquiry is self-understanding (86.6 %) followed by personality development (82.2%) and development of self-concept (81.8%). Although a high percentage of students are knowledgeable about HIV related issues and the risk of unprotected sex, knowledge seems to have little impact on the attitudes towards condom use. From these findings it becomes apparent that secondary students are concerned with sexuality, self-identity and sexual behavior, but it is also apparent that the sex education curriculum has become inadequate to meet students’ needs, especially in the time of HIV/AIDS."

Let cook about 4 minutes or until the first side is lightly browned. Carefully flip the patties with a spatula and let the second side cook until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining patties, using additional olive oil if needed. Top each patty with a bit of shaved Parmesan, a poached egg, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately."

5381,"Josh, the Marlborough born Kiwi from Moa took a flight up to Sydney from Melbourne to be our special guest in Darlo and it turned out to be a memorable night with a lot of new faces and a great Q & Ale session."
5382,"A Pirate Girl’s Treasure: An Origami Adventure by Peyton and Hilary Leung ($18.95, Kids Can Press) that uses the Japanese art of folded paper sculptures combined with a story about a girl whose pirate grandfather sends her a treasure map. This, too, is for the pre-schooler or very early reader, aged four and up. Parents of twins will welcome Take Two! A Celebration of Twins by J. Patrick Lewis and Jane Yolen, illustrated by Sophie Blackall ($16.95, Candlewick) may have something to do with the fact that Lewis is a twin. It is filled with facts about all things “twin”, fraternal, identical, and record-setting, all told with poetry. Daisy’s Perfect Word by Sandra V. Feder and illustrated by Susan Mitchell is a great introduction to independent reading and the joys of playing with language. As a longtime writer, I am biased, but the gift of reading and writing is one of the best a parent can pass along to any youngster."

5386,"Then came Snow White, with a tiny detour into why “fair” was once considered the most beautiful shade of skin (Europe/long time ago/ethnocentrism), and what a stepmother is (“Usually much nicer!”). Why dwarves would all live together was left unexplained. Why they’d keep a dead girl in a glass casket, ditto. He thought the story was cool. At the same time, though, he was very hot, so got into a tepid bath."

5389,"I never really got into the spirit of writing down new year’s resolutions, because I find it so over-hyped. Yet, here I am, writing down my own. 2011 was, at best, just a ho-hum year for me, except for the parts when my sister got married (after 14 years), my nephew turned 4, and my niece turned 1. I have to say that the last months of the year (the -ber months) were more action-packed than the first months."

We would particularly like to thank the award-wining filmmaker David Grubin for making a film on such a matter of profound significance.

I simply never manage to make the cute, little shapes in the milk. I love my milk with a dash of coffee and I do believe the milk-art adds to the overall coffee-experience.

5405,"The picture above is a five year-old young lady - me, photographed reading a bedtime story to one of my very favourite soft toys, my Golly. Sensitive readers must excuse his inclusion on the grounds that: a) this was the 1950s when he was still thought of as a harmless manifestation of popular children’s storybook characters, and b) I loved him, quite literally, to pieces. He was as dear to me as Blue Bunny was, first to my son and then to my grandson. I wouldn’t want to own one now but I’m not going to airbrush him out of my childhood. My Dad would have taken this picture and I wonder what made him choose to capture that moment, the precious half hour before bedtime, reading in the glow of the firelight, before going up to bed and having another good story, either Mrs Tiggywinkle or other Beatrix Potter stories, read by my Mum, or a Freddie and Flossie Frog story, made up by Dad as he went along."

But despite my knowledge of this, I keep on lying to myself! I got this on the way into Central Market with Patti a couple of weeks ago, maybe a week and a half. Because there's a killer (oh hahahaha) potato recipe I've been making that uses rosemary and I thought, oh boy, FRESH rosemary, how wonderful would that be? (Silly, stupid disillusioned woman)! So....we're walking through the store and a lady working in the deli department spotted it and said ""oh, are you going to plant some rosemary? It's very hardy and easy to grow, it'll take over"". I said, ""yes, I'm going to try, but I kill everything""! She said ""I can't get rid of mine, it keeps coming back, even after I put a big rock on top of it, it grew back up around the rock"". I'm just shaking my head, thinking, lady, you don't know me, I'm the grim reaper of plants, seriously."

Now nothing is happening at Putfontein, just subsistence farming and squatting. Some parts of the farm are being hired out to white farmers because the claimants cannot farm. They steal from their neighbours – cattle and grain - which they sell because they cannot make a living on the farm.. There is no electricity, no fencing, and the boreholes are not working. The original Putfontein farm was highly successful, cultivating mealies and peanuts. There was an excellent beef herd with a dairy, plus successful sheep farming. One of the farmers said he spent a lifetime and thousands of rands nourishing the soil on his farm, On his particular 372 ha farm (there were seven farms on the original Putfontein), only six people are now living. The rest stayed in their old homes."

No reply. I asked around on some facebook groups and was told by several people that while Hi Fi orders often take a while to arrive they always DO arrive.

5496,"Determined to drive his reluctant family across country to Wally World in their metallic pea Wagon Queen Family Truckster, Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold is arguably at his funniest in National Lampoon’s Vacation. Chase’s ability for slapstick and physical comedy in practically every scene has rarely been matched in any other comedic film performance. Despite Chase’s screen dominance, director Harold Ramis somehow provides the supporting cast with the opportunity to shine in a number of terrifically funny performances. The movie is nicely held together with the use of a memorable soundtrack and some oddly hilarious musical numbers – all of which make Vacation one of the best comedies of the 1980s (Klaus Ming September 2010)."

But, getting past the first chapter was a challenge; I am not too fond of books that spend too much energy on describing a city instead of subtly weaving these descriptions into the story, and A Passage to India dedicates its entire first chapter to descriptions of the city.

One third of the way through and as I stop to take short pauses, the taste of that Belgian yeast starts to slowly creep in and intensify with each gulp. Interesting. I couldn't smell it or taste it at first, but I guess its characteristics are so embedded in this strange way that it grows and expands."

5540,"I scared a woman to near death this morning. I didn’t mean to. I really didn’t. It is lighter now when I go for my ride but I still had my light on. I slowed to almost a stop. I assumed that she heard my wheels on the bridge (they make a ‘boom, boom’ that is really very satisfying and fairly hard to miss) but when I went past her and said ‘morning’ she uttered obscenities at me."

5548,"For me, in town because of the Sommerakademie residency, every night is a social function of some sort with artists, curators and academics from around the world. People like to say how awful such things are. And receptions are indeed socially awkward but I also think they are great fun. And honestly, as an eager young artist, it’s quite exciting. It’s always fun because what starts as passed champagne and a few speeches always leads to a dinner that ends up a low-key dance party. Maybe Pipilotti Rist is on the dance floor shaking her bottom like a feisty child. And then later maybe Jan Verwoert ends the night playing his Sponge Bob guitar and singing “There Is A Light That Will Never Go Out.” After the annual dinner that marks the finale of the Sommerakademie, evening becomes night and a group of people winding around the quiet downtown looking for a bar open past 1am."

Along the way, Maya learns that her worries about school and not fitting in are far less important than saving herself and her brother from those who want to use the two children for their own ends. The fantasy plot includes a nice riff on the wonderful awfulness of family in our lives, along with our human tendencies towards both selfishness and selflessness."

5558,"The first album I got my paws on was Ten. Everything on this album was basically giving a voice to a generation. My generation. Speaking to youth that was not represented at that time in the media. All of a sudden the disaffected kids who weren't buying into the 'yellow brick road' route, had a group of musicians who articulated their feelings through music. It was a soundtrack to life. It was the soundtrack to my life. Which sounds hokey. But, literally, played in my headphones on the daily. Soothed the disconnected feelings I felt and in turn made me feel a little less disconnected. Songs like: Deep, Black, Jeremy, Release - these songs cannot be replicated. Cannot be duplicated. It's pretty much a Blade Runner type situation for me. As I have followed their career over twenty years, at times, they were the water that filled the space between the pebbles of my mind. Flowing in between, sometimes taking up more space than before and sometimes less. A relationship."
5559,"Then something quite dramatic happened and my musical taste changed almost overnight. I’ll never forget it. I was in what was Our Price records shop at Gatwick South Terminal. The year was 1987 and the girl in the shop, dressed entirely in black and with spiky purple hair put a cassette tape on while she was behind the counter. Suddenly this big, loud booming drum machine started playing and a thumping baseline kicked in. I was like “Oh wow! What is this?” The song I was hearing and first introduced me to a whole new darker side of music was The Sisters Of Mercy. The song was Dominion. The intro to that song blew me away and I craved more of the same. I bought the album there and then. This was the start of my gothic revolution, a darker side of me that is still very evident to this day."

5563,"This works for every issue, I simply chose to use some of the most divisive and politically charged issues I could think of. We have convinced ourselves that we know better how our neighbor should live their life, that we try to use government to enforce our values on someone else. Who gave us the right to dictate what someone does in their own home? Do you want the government coming in to your living room and telling you what to do? Of course not."
5564,"America's democracy promotion agenda is understood in China as designed to sabotage the Communist Party’s leadership. The leadership therefore actively promotes efforts to guard against the influence of American ideology and U.S. thinking about democracy, human rights, and related issues. This perceived American effort to divide and weaken China has been met by building increasingly powerful and sophisticated political and technological devices to safeguard domestic stability. U.S. arms sales to Taiwan despite vastly improved cross-Strait relations—and close-in surveillance activities off China's coasts—contribute to Beijing's deepening distrust of U.S. strategic intentions in the national security arena. Washington’s recent rebalancing toward Asia further contributes to this sense of threat. American diplomatic positions spanning North Korea, Iran, and countries in Southeast Asia are discomfiting and increase Chinese suspicions of U.S. intentions. China’s criticisms of, and resistance to, some of America’s international policies and actions toward the Korean Peninsula, Iran, Syria, and elsewhere reflect the suspicion that they are based on injustice and narrow U.S. self-interest that will directly or indirectly affect China’s interests.

But more importantly, it is Shakespeare’s one work that may be considered an addition to the fantasy genre. Miranda’s character is certainly young (she’s fifteen), but she has a gentle heart and a fresh, untainted view of the world, which fits well with the meaning of her name: “worthy of admiration or wonder.” Her father is a sorcerer, and she is associated with art and magic."

A more fitted skirt balances out the loose blouse and gives just the right amount of formal flair to an otherwise casual look. Nude heels also add a hint of sophistication to the outfit, and are definitely a staple that every woman needs in her wardrobe."

I can relate with this as I find arguments from the problem of evil to be somewhat plausible, making me less certain of, though not defeating my belief in God. No matter what one ultimately thinks of Monton’s book, the takeaway should be that truth is the goal of inquiry, not whether we are “doing science” or “being religious.”"

5655,"This could very well be one of the verses that influenced later Hindu movements and the emphasis on ahimsa, or the concept of committing no violence against any living thing. Buddha was the first prominent party to vehemently embrace and preach nonviolence. He preached his first sermon at Sarnath, just north of Varanasi, one of the holiest cities in Hinduism. We know that he renounced his life as a privileged prince and sought solitude, peace and tranquility. Knowing what we do about the civilization one has to wonder what it was that triggered this distaste for the life he was born into. Given that there were none of the car, motorcycle or bus horns blaring and the population nowhere nearly as maddening as it is in present day, what was it that was so chaotic he needed to escape? It may have been all the suffering he was witnessing. The noise and calamity of suffering. The bleating of sheep, cries of goats, moans of cattle living in horrid conditions as beasts of burden and then at the end, led to their butchering and as a royal prince, he would have been privy to these as common occurrences. Maybe underneath it all, the basic motivator of the Buddha was that he held empathy for all living creatures and just couldn’t stand the cries from anymore lengthy rituals. He loved being in the forest where he could just sit and the deer would come up to him, fearless of the docile human. His teachings were poetic, soft and sometimes nearly in playful riddles and codes. He relished in the quiet that an environment of nonviolence afforded him and it must have been a welcome concept to the masses judging by the impact his life had on the community and ages to come."

All is the same, except the boy I moved for ('muffin') is no longer, and in my heart I knew things were not going to work out with him even as I was packing my bags to move. Something stuck with me though, and I knew that I needed to move for some reason. I told myself that I was going to make it work for at least a year (as long as my lease term was).

For a moment, he stared into fascinatingly beautiful deep emerald eyes contrasted against pale skin and soft light-colored red hair. What he caught a glimpse of within sent lust rushing over him instantly. Earlier in the evening, he’d not given much conscious thought to the woman other than she was Giselle’s aunt, and a royal pain in the arse.

5695,"Stone's production, co-translated with Tom Wright (not to be confused with Thomas M. Wright, who is playing Baal), is a serious and often brilliant attempt at Brecht's play. Although the script is hugely cut, it sticks closely to the original text, transposing its obscenities and undeniable beauties into contemporary colloquial English. Likewise, Brecht's songs are set to electric guitar by Stefan Gregory, but remain ballads rather than rock'n'roll. Baal is no Thyestes or The Wild Duck, in which a new text is spun out of the bones of the original, so here the estrangements of poetry are added to the alienations produced by its lead character."

However, Self does seem to feel a sense of mourning or acknowledge a loss of innocence from addressing the reality that ‘Erotic Capital’ portrays, through Hakim’s notion of female gender empowerment through sexual empowerment. QRG also addresses this as a form of a backward step in the journey towards equality. Self rightly points out how Hakim creates strange bedfellows of radical feminists and the religiously conservative, and how they have similar views on the public display of feminine sexuality."

Parry had a shady reputation, and it's been suggested he went over to Wallace's house with the intention of stealing the insurance takings.

When I read a sample of one of his books, the absence of commas before names in direct speech irritated me, so much, that I'm confident I wouldn't be able to read one of his books. Nothing to do with the quality, but I just hate this particular comma not being where it belongs. I know you can see from the sentence if it needs a comma or not. (Age old: 'Let's eat grandma' vs. 'Let's eat, grandma'), but if you use it in one case and not so in another, it would make an inconsistent use. To me, that is.

5821,"While we focused our attention primarily on the students, the learning environment was also part of our reflection. We “walked the walls” of the classrooms and hallways to see how visuals speak to learning: what kinds of charts and other visual aides are present and what models of good work are available to students. We explored the physical arrangement of the classroom, wondering about how the organization of space facilitates learning. We examined classroom resources such as libraries, computers and interactive whiteboards, considering whether the arrangement of books facilitates good use by students and how computers and the class interactive whiteboard are used to promote learning. We compared resources from classroom to classroom, pondering whether adequate resources are equally accessible to all students."

If she continues to improve and can sit up etc they will send her to rehab, where they will work with her on relearning things she can't do right now due to the stroke. After 1 week in rehab, they will reevaluate and decide if she can continue. If neither of those things go right, she'll be put into a long term care facility (why they don't say nursing home is beyond me). It kills me though, she did NOT want to be in a home. A 24 hour nurse at home is out of the question, per the doctors. She will require to much care they say... It breaks my heart, she's got no choice, we've tried to honor her wishes, she did now want any surgery (which could have prevent the loss of some of the functions) and if she goes into cardiac arrest, she is DNR/DNI.

5848,"Ava and I have been talking about taking the kids overseas for a while now and, after a couple of opportunities popped up on our radar screen, we decided it was time to start the process of getting passports for them. One of the more worrisome elements of this process for me was getting the necessary pictures done. Passport photos have to be arranged in a particular way. The subject has to be standing alone against a blank background and looking directly at the camera. Pip is old enough to follow instructions and not get freaked out by having some stranger with a camera standing between him and me. With Polly, I wasn’t so sure. I had visions of her being nervous and uncooperative. Then, I imagined, I would have to try and hold her while ducking down low enough to be out of the frame of the picture as the photo clerk struggled to get her to look directly at the camera long enough to get a good shot. It was not a situation I wanted to deal with. But, we needed the pictures so I packed up Pip and Polly and took them down to the local Walgreens."

5899,"In her response to Mordecai Esther points out how that she has not been called to come in to the king FOR thirty days? Is that correct? No! Esther does not say ‘for’ thirty days; but rather “these thirty days”. “These” is a demonstrative pronoun pointing to something in particular. What is Esther pointing to, or referring to? Esther is referring to the topic she and Mordecai have been discussing, the horrible law that all the Jews must die. Esther is explaining to Mordecai that she has not had any opportunity to go in and see the king during the entire period in which this law has been given. From the 13th day of the 1st month, until now, 30 days later, Esther has not been called in to the king. Perhaps you are wondering why this is significant for us to know? The reason is that this information now helps us to date the conversation between Esther and Mordecai. At the point Esther makes this statement and has it sent to Mordecai through her servant, it is 30 days after the law was first given. This would mean that they were discussing these things on the 13th day of the 2nd month (note: a spread sheet of Ahasuerus’ 12th year is available and we hope to have it posted on ebiblefellowship.com shortly)."

She assumed first position and began a series of plies. I was absolutely enchanted. She moved like a dream. Her motions were liquid and graceful, yet full of strength. She probably ended after only a few plies, embarrassed by my gawking, but I only remember her endless smooth bends and proud carriage.

And as he sat in his home he could not figure out what to do with it until he came up with a brilliant idea. He would build many barns and store his food in the barns. What would we say of such a man? We would think him horrible, greedy, and, basically, worthless. Yet don’t we do this very thing with our lives? In this very city there are organizations that could serve the marginalized, oppressed, and impoverished in such dynamic ways, if only they had the volunteers to do it."

5951,"The once-powerful states, which created the federal government by ratifying the Constitution, have become -- in the words of Mark Levin -- ""administrative appendages of the federal government."" The states are subject to ever-increasing federal regulation, strangled by dictates from agencies old and new, and held hostage through billions in federal tax dollars. Levin asks, ""Does anyone believe that the states would have originally ratified the Constitution had they known this would be their fate?"""
5952,"I've been following your posts for a long time, and have always really appreciated the honesty and heart you put into every entry, especially this one. I grew up on the homemade kaya my father made (its impossible to find in the States), and will always remember his patience with my banging about in the kitchen while he laboriously stirred. It wasn't until five years after his passing that I learned he never cared for the stuff, and had always gone out of his way to make it for me. For years, the tall narrow jam jar had always been full and dutifully refilled, and the smooth, sweet kaya spread on crisp toast in a heart shape on my birthday without fail, into my high school years until he passed away. And never having known he had always done it for me! It's amazing to see that this love for family and the food we cook and eat with them is so universal, and so beautiful to see how their memories live on this way. This was an a great post, full of great memories."

I made a commitment to reduce the amount of supermarket and “instant” produce I consumed.

Ive shunned my microwave and returned to slow cooking, and Im switching to “clean” recipes that dont require artificial foods."

It was an ambitious goal, and despite some solid support, we only raised a little over 10% of the goal. But we are not giving up. We're scaling back a bit, and there's a NEW Kickstarter out there: we're trying to raise $6,000 to do one pilot episode. We got that much before, but we had 60 days that time.

5977,"Another interesting theory tossed out: Having felons serve their sentences day for day could be reducing the number of parole violators in county jails, since if they're not being supervised they can't be arrested for violations: “'Instead of releasing (prisoners) conditionally on parole, some states are using expiration of sentence, which is (when prisoners) serve their full sentence and then they’re released,' Harrison said. 'Early indicators suggest that if you’re not watching recently released inmates, they’re not going to come back into your purview.

6036,"“The expressive potential of the courtroom as symbol of an exalted process is exploited to perhaps its highest potential in Rogers’s Bordeaux courthouse where the seven courtrooms are fully revealed as separate elevated objects. The inventive power of the scheme lies in the clarifying simplicity of its organization: the essence of the courthouse is reduced to two elements, courtrooms and administrative block, each set on opposing plinths and united by a hovering roof plane. The courtrooms are expressed as highly sculptural wooden vessels, set in contrast to the mute neutrality of the glass office block. Freed from the enveloping crust of support spaces typical of the American courthouse typology, each courtroom is a discrete monument announcing the building’s purpose and meaning, without need of an intervening architectural overlay. The circulation elements that connect to the courtrooms – open bridges and stairs – emphasize the separation of the bureaucratic elements of the court from the courtroom, implying that all who enter the room do so openly and equally, without special advantage."

6043,"A typical 'street photographer' style can be recognized in Sternfeld's early and as yet unknown work, using a 35mm camera, to record everyday life in America. This work already contained the characteristics that made his later work so successful. In 1978, Joel Sternfeld began a long journey through the United States. For eight years he crisscrossed his homeland and recorded everything he encountered with his large-format camera. His investigation into the landscape and people moving within it resulted in the American Prospects series (1979-1983). In Stranger Passing (1987-2000) Sternfeld concentrated on people. He photographed them in an unambiguous way: from the same distance and looking directly into the camera. This series is a portrait of a society, comparable to the magnum opus of August Sander in the early twentieth century. Just as in American Prospect, there is evidence of a light absurdism as well as sympathy for those being portrayed."

6068,"The biggest question facing Mozilla is whether or not it can sell users on the idea of Firefox as a content-delivery ecosystem rather than just a browser. Much of the work coming in the second half of the year is focused on delivering social integration and additional services that the group hopes willdistinguish it from Chrome and IE10. At the moment, Firefox’s appeal is hard to quantify — it’s no longer the safe, sane, alternative browser, and Chrome has usurped its reputation for speed. It still offers features and capabilities Chrome lacks, but Mozilla’s market share has slumped in recent years. If the group sticks to its roadmap, it’s got a decent chance of reversing that trend — there’s a potent mixture of performance updates, new features, and additional capabilities in the pipeline, as well as cutting-edge support for Metro and Windows 8 when the latter launches."

6070,"While I thought this was pretty clear, lots of people didn’t. From looking around on Rotten Tomatoes, this accounts for 15% of the reviews, tops. This brings up another question: Why should Snyder’s intent matter? What’s the point of making a movie to criticize pigs who yell catcalls at women on ComicCon panels if they don’t even understand they are being criticized (and may even interpret it the opposite way and like it) and the only people who “get it” are film nerds who weren’t a part of the problem? This is a legitimate concern, which I will address in-depth in future articles, but the short answer is that this applies to pretty much everything to some degree. Every couple of years, someone tries to get Huckleberry Finn banned from a school library on the grounds that it’s racist for using the word “nigger” repeatedly. Defenders will argue this is meant to depict the realities of racism at the time and it’s actually about realizing that racism is all a pack of lies spread by repugnant people. (Which is oversimplifying, but no sense spending a bunch more space on a book you’re all familiar with.) The fact that a lot of people see this won’t make the objectors feel any better. There is no magic percentage of people buying any particular interpretation that can make it correct. To the people who like it, Sucker Punch a good film, and I think that that’s enough. I think part of the problem was that the MPAA forced a critical scene to be cut and the director’s cut would have gone over somewhat better, but an R-film would have made less money. I still harbor some suspicion that Showgirls is a brilliant social satire that somehow no one has managed to understand as of yet. How can we ever condemn anything in this case? That’s a tricky issue which I will address later."
6071,"It is of crucial importance to note that whenever reference is made to the Great Trek, it is always said that the ""Boers"" took part in the Great Trek. There was no ""Afrikaner"" Great Trek, and there were no ""Afrikaner"" Great Trek Leaders, just Boer Great Trek Leaders. This is an indication that at this stage already the Boers had developed an identify of their own, as distinct from the Cape Dutch and English settlers of the Cape."
6072,"Bin Laden’s death does not bring justice to those who lost loved ones because of his actions; it does not end a war; it does not do the will of God. I can rejoice in the end of his leadership but in his death, I cannot. I will not. This is a time to mourn how justice was not served to 9/11 victims and to him. As I type this I can feel the anger that some people will have with these words and I can feel the hate that some will have for me because I am saying them. This is why it needs to be said. Bin Laden was a man, a human, a child of God. It is a tragedy that we killed him instead of trying to redeem him. It is by loving those that the world and ourselves deem “unlovable” that we follow in the footsteps of Christ."

Simulators prepare us for the experience of battle, and they hone our reflexes and our skills at the particular task. There is also some mental conditioning at work to distance soldiers from the realities of their job: That there are real human beings at the receiving end of their rifles. While there may be some truth to this, there is a vast chasm of difference between killing an opponent in a video game and the harsh reality of death in real life.

He was always saying stuff like ""You will never guess what this thing is"" and ""It's going to be the best gift ever"". Personally, I usually don't like surprises and I constantly tried to keep guessing what the hell it could be. He then kept throwing me off by saying stuff like he ""couldn't get the official one but he got something like it that's just as good"" (which turned out to be a lie because the product turned out to be officially licensed). Then they didn't bill him for it until way later than he expected which in turn meant they shipped it later and I had to wait an extra week. I was getting anxious and he was getting pissed that it was taking longer then expected. He called me on Friday saying it was on his way to his house and that I should come over to open it.

Women, who were mainly the K-12 teachers historically, began to realize they could work outside the classroom, even in academia. Teachers began to leave the classroom for other higher paying positions, particularly those who were the creative types and had a background in math, science or the ability to sell something. New teachers began to be trained at an alarming rate and quality control began to, in some regards dissipate and in other areas quality improved. There was stasis no more within the system and this began a change in the profile of what a good education seemed to be – a change that we are now reaping in the 21st Century."

One of the conference organizers sent me an e-mail letting me know that I should expect upwards of 100 people to attend my session and possibly many more. I had forgotten to let them know that I was planning on an intimate workshop of about 20 people. Now what was I going to do? I never would have set out to do a hands-on session for more than 20 people, let alone 100 or more!"

Everybody, absolutely everybody (myself included) wears a rucksack at University and I've seen many a L.L Bean rucksack bob past with with neatly embroidered initials on; I'm always a sucker for a bit of personalisation. Kind of like the name tags we had sewn into the collars of our school jumpers at school, I like that this is a leftover bag, a sort of second nature thing to sling on your shoulder that's been carrying your books for years."
6225,"Then there’s the local white witch, Miss Hawthorne, played to utterly kooky perfection by Damaris Hayman, a character that’s sort of emblematic of how much fun this story is. Another great character is Professor Horner, played by Robin Wentworth. He only appears in Episode One, but every single utterance that comes out of his mouth is priceless. It’s almost a shame he wasn’t kept around for the rest of the story. Words escape me for how perfect Roger Delgado is here. But then, words always escape me for how good he was as the Master. There have been many Doctors, and there have many fine debates over which is the best, but anyone, with any amount of taste, must surely admit that Delgado’s Master has never been bested"

Still, just to count, Naxxramas has 3 wings of undead bosses, plus the last two bosses at the end, totaling 14 (counting the horsemen separately), and even if you cut all the weird undead that are no longer really humanoid, you have Razuvious, Heigan, Noth, Gothik, and the Four horsemen, totaling 8."

The module details a ruined castle and its dungeons in a swamp that are pretty generic and are easily dropped into most any campaign setting. While the main plot of foiling the plans of cultists has been done to death, this one does have a clever twist to it by having a table of curses that characters may either start with as a hook or fall prey to while adventuring in the module. Some of the curses are helpful (but only at expense of others) like- ""Anytime an uncursed PC suffers a critical hit, the cursed PC gains 1d6 temporary hp"" and some are just evil like ""The character develops an insatiable desire for human blood; his maximum hit point total is reduced by 5 every day that he does not indulge the mad craving.""

6339,"What are entropic repulsions? You really want to know? You really want to know. Oh so warm and fuzzy-happy! Let me explain… Entropy is popularly defined as “chaos and disorder”. A somewhat more accurate way to describe entropy is “number of configurations”. There are different flavors of entropy too – different entropic contributions to free energy. In high school and college chemistry we all learn about a mysterious “chemical” entropy fudge factor. In a dedicated Thermodynamics class you might see mixing entropy and the entropy associated with phase transitions (water to steam is common). In polymers, there are additional contributions to entropy. These arise because a polymer is made of a bunch of smaller molecules linked together to form a floppy chain. The floppiness of the polymer chain allows it to take many distinct floppy shapes or conformations. More shapes = more configurations = more entropy (simply stated)."

There is a difference here between what the legal consequences of any error would be and the public relations and corporate ones. If it is the case that James Murdoch did see the email at the time, then I imagine his explanation would be that he had simply forgotten this, on the basis that many things have happened over the years since the payment was authorised, and that he has seen many items regarding this whole affair. If Mr Watson had been afforded the chance of prolonged questioning on this point, then perhaps James Murdoch would have found himself in a position where it would be hared to explain this as a lapse of memory. Interestingly, the following exchange between Mr Whittingdale and Mr Watson took place just after the above question was asked."

6350,"The political angle isn't whether we should consider externalities, but whether we will consider the externalities and which ones. Greenhouse gas externalities will not be fully priced in for decades, especially for costs imposed on areas outside of the country where the gases are produced (why should we care about those effects?), but they will start to weigh in, a bit, on costs. The brand new mercury rule shows some of the other externalities of fossil fuels will start getting price tags as well.

The first cold winter, school, her marriage to Daniel, the births of Jasmyn, Dillan and Joel. She offered her cancer, her anger, her fear. She offered everything and hoped it would be enough. Because now it was Christmas Day, and she’d already seen two miracles. Surely a third wasn’t too much to ask."

He is forced – against his will - to participate in the investigation of various unsolved mysteries by insufferably pretentious children, who fancy themselves to be modern-day Sherlock Holmeses. And his role during these activities is either to amuse these children with buffoonish antics or allow himself to be patronized by them in the most irritating manner.

They come from within. They do not come from the cottages of the wage earners. They come from a peculiar type of brainy people always found in our country who, if they add something to the culture, take much from its strength. Our difficulties come from the mood of unwarrantable self-abasement into which we have been cast by a powerful section of our own intellectuals. They come from the acceptance of defeatist doctrines by a large portion of our politicians. But what have they to offer but a vague internationalism, a squalid materialism, and the promise of impossible utopias?""

Being ten players we made 5 couples and one did not play each round. I didn’t on the first one so only took one battle on the first day. I was paired with Trollbloods with eGrissel and I honestly think it’s the most balanced couple (I brought eSorscha with all weapon master infantry and two Devastators), even though we lost to a sneaky move by my favorite (most hated too) Circle player after killing almost all of his army (eKrueger if I recall?) and his partner’s (some epic Legion warlock girl, I can’t remember who)."

Jñānāgni-dagdha-karmāṇam: the fire of knowledge burns up all reactions of sinful activities. It is the most potent of purifiers.

A huge, overwhelming turning point of a month. Do not expect clarity. But you can expect a lot of help. As weird and wild and crazy as the vibes are, May is loaded with positive synchronicity.” The 39 minutes reveals all sorts of unusual layers in what looks to be a highly charged month on many levels:"

For now, let me pose this question: if you had to drink beer from only Oregon breweries that were older than three years or younger than three years, which would you choose? Given the number of extraordinarily accomplished venerable breweries in this state (Hair of the Dog, Pelican, Caldera, Double Mountain, Widmer, Full Sail, Deschutes, etc.), this should be a no-brainer.

But about half way through, when Knausgaard changed locale and focus, I found myself gripped and even able to better appreciate what had come before. You could argue that the speed-writing approach (all six volumes of this series appear to have been written in about three years in total) makes for a slightly unsatisfactory reading experience in places but I found that once my brain had clicked with the book I was happy to follow Knausgaard's flighty train of thought anywhere it wanted to take me and it wasn't just the quality of the writing that pleased me but the bravery and power of it which rendered the few books I read afterwards tame by comparison."

I want, so much, for the people who read my book to love it and my characters and my story like I do. Consequently, I am really afraid that some won’t.

I've been asking for a puppy for Christmas ever since our new neighbor puppy found her way into our backyard and spent a couple of afternoons with us until her family got home. There were so many cute animals at the shelter, so we chose a few dogs we were interested in, but as we stood in line, most of the dogs we had chosen were claimed by other folks. There was one left, the one BubTar was really interested in, so we asked to see him. They told us he was ""snappish"" when he came in and maybe not a good idea with the kids, but another worker said he was VERY sweet and had warmed to him quickly. So we went ahead and asked to visit with him. He was SO pitiful! He just cowered in the middle of the room...no sniffing, no licking, no wagging. Nothing. He just laid still, probably hoping no one would hit him. :( He definitely wasn't aggressive towards us, though. Not a growl or snarl or anything. He was too scared to move, I think. He wasn't available to be adopted yet, since he had only been in the shelter for a day, but we filled out a non-binding application so we would be first in line if we decided to get him. Since we already have a dog, they told us we needed to bring her up so they could meet before we could adopt him, so we made plans to do that on Monday."

I worked in Jordan in the year 2007 with a renowned Jordanian women organization as a coordinator of Iraqi Refugees in Jordan. This organization presents itself as progressive leftist. They participated in many protests against the invasion of Iraq. Of course, this gives strong indication that they are patriots who have principles. Therefore, I agreed to work with them even though my directions are more moderate religious and independent. I never was associated with party or extremism. They were secular. I told myself, I don’t care about their religion. All I care about is their disclosed principles that root for women rights and invaded nations such as Iraq and Palestine. But after one month of working there, I discovered the secrets of management within the organization. I observed the ciaos, indifference and bad management. I observed lying and cheating in documenting projects for fund providers. The manager justified it as natural right to obtain the fund to pay for organization utility bills (water, electricity) and salaries of our permanent employees…"

In lay and specialist circles alike, the meaning of the term “mother tongue” ranges from ‘first language’, through ‘best language’, to ‘main language’. We sometimes even find mother tongue equated to “L1”, a term belonging to an intriguing tradition of identifying languages by numbers. I will have quite a few things to say about 1st Ls and other numbered Ls in future, but what these supposed definitions of mother tongue have in common is that they are all undefined themselves. So saying that your mother tongue is, for example, your best language, or vice versa, if you don’t know what a mother tongue or a best language might be, is like explaining that sulphuric acid is H2SO4 and that H2SO4 is sulphuric acid, if you have no idea what sulphuric acid and H2SO4 might be."

6661,"One of the ongoing conversation that we have in this country is what to do with our youth. How do we develop them into the next generation that will continue this country’s legacy of greatness? This conversation normally begins with the home. Are mom and dad both serving as shining examples of what that productive citizen should be? Someone who provides shelter, guidance, food, spiritual growth and unconditional love. Is both mom and dad even there?"

6664,"First, It should be known that this album was recorded in 1977 but not released until 1980 due to RCA claiming it being ""not commercial."" Sacred Songs starts normal enough. Glammy 70s soul in the style of Bowie with those signature Hall & Oates harmonies that we all have grown up to love (or hate) so well. But something really weird happens halfway through track 3. The album is not normal anymore. Something alien occurs. Something takes it over and brings it to some other-worldly level of heaviness, beauty and weird that is ultra rare in music nowadays. Was it due to the undeniable influence majik and the occult had on the recording and writing process?"

6673,"Spain has a 57 on the cultural scale of Hofstede’s analysis. Compared to Arab countries where the power distance is very high (80) and Austria where it is very low (11), Spain is somewhat in the middle on the continum. However, the country does lean toward a higher level of inequality. For instance, Spain has an unequal distribution of wealth and there is a distance gap between the wealthy and lower-income society. The country tries to close the chasm by creating many government sponsered programs such as universal health care."

6675,The second problem with the United Nations is that it has no ability to enforce its resolutions. I would give it the authority to create a military force that would be capable of intervening in disputes between members or in cases of civil war. This force would enable the United Nations to offer a guarantee of support for any member nation that may be attacked. It would free up resources from countries like the United States that have been dealing with these sorts of problems around the world — the United Nations is the proper instrument for action in these cases.

And root beer is the most vile substance on this planet (concentrated cat urine is a more palatable alternative than root beer).
6699,"So just as it is the case that cooker fixing, or even camel training, have nothing to do with Islam or the Koran, so we can say that science, when practised by a Muslim, has nothing to do with Islam or the Koran. Even the oft-quoted passage in the Koran about ‘searching out knowledge as far as China’ does not lead directly, or even indirectly, to science and knowledge. Not only that, they are exclusively about religious knowledge anyway. It would be silly to say that there is even a smidgen or genuine science or even philosophy in the Koran."

We all wished there was something we could do to help, but there wasn’t. Either way she was going to become the un-dead. I only wished it happened quicker for her, going through all those symptoms seemed like torture. And when there is not a damn thing you can do, it starts to become heavy on the heart. In fact I debated about putting in how she turned for a long time, but in the end I decided that although it hurts; it happened and maybe by writing this out I can make it easier for whoever reads this."

6712,"This isn’t the first run-in on campaign finance law-breaking for Ms. Brogan (who is closely associated with local hack blogger Keith Clark). She ran unsuccessfully for county commissioner two years ago and one or more of her campaign reports remained in error for many months. Were it not for the good graces of our local Board of Elections, Ms. Brogan could have been charged with a misdeameanor and fined $500 for her malfeasance. Is this a behavior she learned from Keith Clark? Is this what we can expect from PIG PAC candidates running for office?"

6715,For a year of so now I have been working on finding the perfect beer paring for this cheese but its strength in flavour and slight dry astringency has made it difficult to pair with many of the local session beers. But out of much trial and error and some success with Belgian Pale ales and strong English pale ales it seems Durham Brewery's Benedictus has proved itself as the ultimate match for this characterful local cheese.

6717,"This weeks episode of Kimi To Boku revolves around Akira, an unknown character. He’s Koichi’s friend from high school, who is short, looks young, and is immature like Tachibana. He doesn’t really have much common sense, and he’s kind of oblivious towards his surroundings. Though, if this episode was going to focus on Akira, they should of given us a little bit more of a background than they did. I kept wondering if he was a teacher, or some karate teacher because he flipped someone onto the ground, which was pretty awesome."
6718,"I asked at two more places. Homes, this time. At the first place they were sitting outdoors, the man, his wife moving some hay, the kids playing, some other guy working by the wall. I was very discreet and indirect, dropping hints. Is there a place to stay somewhere here? Just sleep, actually, since I have my own stuff. No, no, not a hotel, a school maybe? A post-office? There’s a hotel 2k down the road, he said, or try the town you just left behind. I asked directly at the next place, using the single largest Kannada sentence I knew, nanage illi ondu ratri irrakolakke jaaga kodake aggatta? will it be possible to give me a place to stay here for one night?

It got me thinking as to what obstacles stop me from writing and what I can do about them."

6729,"I’ve been thinking about monsters lately. Perhaps it’s because of the death of Maurice Sendak, author and illustrator of Where The Wild Things Are. He famously brought childhood monsters out from under the bed and into the pages of a book. In interviews, Sendak would claim that he never wrote specifically for children. Other people, most likely his publishers, decided who the audience for his books should be. There were critics – they believed his stories contained harsh truths and disturbing images that could scare children."
6730,"The easiest argument is the one that is often used in this case. Perry’s films make money, while Spike’s not as much. Let’s be clear. No one including Spike, can knock Tyler Perry’s hustle. No one does that better. But do you think that Lil’ Wayne is a better emcee than Nas or KRS-One because he sells more downloads? Do you believe that a Big Mac is better than a Ruth Chris sirloin because they sell more volume? The fact is that it is undeniable that Perry is a better business man then Spike, but not a better teacher. Ultimately, when it’s all said and done, if I had to choose what to put in the time capsule for generations of the future to use as a case study of what our generations film making legacy would be, I’ve got to go with the little dude from Brooklyn. I guess that’s the professorial, Obama trait in me, overtaking the hustler, Diddy trait in me. I just think our future would be better off."

6735,"What I was thinking about in the last few minutes is relationships. I think that most married people come to various points in their relationship with each other where they are forced to ask, is there room for change? If one of us changes, is there room for that in this marriage? If you see a marriage as a system, then change in one part will force a change in the other part. So, if I change, can you handle it."

6747,"I need to confess something about eggs; while I love them dearly, and really, think that it is one food item that I will never give up eating, I have been rather stubbornly affixed to only consuming them when cooked good and solid. I’ve had an aversion to the soft yolk ways for as long as I can recall, and I simply can’t say why. I don’t care for them scrambled either, and no matter how well they’re scrambled, so soft and pillowy and silky smooth, I just won’t eat them. I think it must be the texture. As I’ve grown and watched my food tastes change, the one aspect of it that I’ve noticed is that formerly despised foods were all about texture over flavor. Still, as I can now manage mushrooms, squash, tomato, avocado and a host of other goodies that were once verboten on my table, I draw the line at scrambled eggs. Still, the fact that I just knew this roasted rutabaga dish required a poached egg, that I then went ahead and made, beautifully, is huge growth for this egg lover. And I may never look back again."

Ted Williams, who roamed in front of the Green Monster for the Red Sox from 1939-1960, may not have been just the greatest left fielder of all-time, but the greatest hitter of all-time.

Moaning at the touch she trembled again. Time was running out, she knew she needed to be ready. Taking a deep breath she spread herself and pushed the plug against her tight pouting ass. As the thickest part of it finally passed the tight ring of her pulsing ass she sighed and squirmed.

While that’s true, in private he is also keen to reach out the the Far Right’s leaders, and put the slavishly pro-bailout Pasok out of power. To do so, Samaras yesterday focused on his Rightist credentials, saying he would get tough on crime, repeal laws giving citizenship to second generation immigrants born in Greece, and allow police to use water cannons to break up protests.

I can see why you might if the money the magazine paid you for your story was for charity, but some of the stories in these magazines leave me thinking why people do it? Well, for the money I guess, or, of course, writing about what happened can work as therapy. It can also serve as a warning to others: this happened to me. Don't let it happen to you. I'm not sure I'd do it, no matter how much they paid. Could I write about something horrific that happened to someone I know, with their consent, either? The answer would probably be no. It takes all kinds of writer to write all kinds of things, maybe you're different and could write a piece like that. It's something to think about."
6795,"Opposing such a bill in the collegial and newly Republican Senate was futile, but the House Judiciary Committee offered a forum that would look more closely at the change the measure implied for property rights. This idea of “condemnation on demand” was not a high visibility issue, and there was no groundswell against it since the idea was not widely known. The opposition alliance’s “legislative inside baseball” strategy was to first get it assigned to the House Judiciary Committee then to focus arguments on “protecting private property rights”—something all legislators reflexively support."
6796,Not all candidates are up to the challenge but for the most part they do put on a show of family devotion that is there to soothe the apprehension of the voter to at least assume that he/she must be a “good person” if the wife and progeny are willing to stand alongside and smile.

There are many times in life when cure and healing seem to overlap. If you are hungry, the cure is food. If you are sick, a cure is health. Yet seeking cure is sometimes treating a symptom."

Later I became an investigator including a robbery investigator. I have spent countless hours in interrogation rooms talking to hold up men. I know them.

Sadly it is my impression that, even at the relatively modest sum which these companies charge, virtually no use is made of their services by anyone who submits material for publication in JIPLP. This is a pity, since poor-quality text distracts peer reviewers and incurs extra, quite unnecessary labour for the editing and production staff. Good-quality proof reading would benefit not merely those contributors who are not native English-speakers but those who are and who, because they have never learned the rules of their native language or have forgotten them, sometimes produce texts of woeful quality."

But arguing with him is a waste of time because no matter how reasonable he thinks he is, he won’t consider anyone else’s opinion because if it isn’t the same as his, they’re talking nonsense. I couldn’t tell him I was angry because he’d have told me I was being unreasonable and I wasn’t as sick as my cousin was when she was anorexic and I hadn’t gone too far down that path so I was alright, I would be fine.

6901,"Last week Charlie Gilmour, son of writer and photographer Polly Samson and stepson of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, was jailed for sixteen months for violent disorder. He was strung out on booze, drugs and lack of sleep and misbehaved significantly on the student protest against spending cuts in central London last December. Nobody, himself included, denied that he had been a Very Naughty (and Silly) Boy. There was a financial value to the damage he did, although the extent of that damage remains open to debate. He was seen to kick, but not break, a window and deemed to have thrown a bin at the car carrying Charlie Windsor and his missus. He had earlier swung himself on the Cenotaph flag. All in all, not a good day. I'm sure he wasn't too surprised to find himself in court. He issued an apology pretty much as soon as he'd had a chance to sober up, but having had his collar felt, must have expected that matters would be taken further as indeed they were."

The illustrations for Pottermore look like paintings (but they might be drawings – I haven’t been able to find out what they are yet) and they’re beautiful. Occasionally, a scene is too dark in my opinion, which makes it hard to find things or even to know what’s going on. In a Pottermore review on another nerdy blog, the author mentioned that Pottermore was quiet in the beta testing period. It is still in beta, but now they’ve gotten rid of that silence issue, as I discovered when I had to mute the sounds of the website to continue listening to my Harry Potter music. You can hear the owls and cats on Platform 9 3/4, for example. So sometimes I listen to the Pottermore audio, and sometimes I listen to something like this, which I am currently obsessed with."

On passing I had a look in my rear view mirror to see Retard move straight back out into the middle of the road but this time he moved all the way over to the other side of the road into the path of a car coming the other way. All I can think is that he was playing chicken with whatever cars came his way.

I had forgotten that for some people writing involves a lot of procrastination. I also didn't realize that I would be wanting to write and write and write without stopping. I would get up in the morning while the girls were still asleep so that I could get in a couple solid undisturbed hours. Then I would focus on food needs. The week was unusually sunny and warm so we took a lot of walks to enjoy the weather get our vitamin D before the rains returned. Late afternoon I would write for a while since the younger two were often playing with friends. However, stopping to make dinner was a challenge. Most of the time I really wanted to keep working. I was writing on a desktop in the kitchen that couldn't go online. It was good to not have the option of going online because that would have been an easy distraction. However, it was hard to write in the kitchen when the house was full of people or the TV was on in the evening."

Mainly because the pigs eat them once they find them. But who could blame a pig for doing that? I'd do it. Does that make me a pig? Don't answer that. So anyway, I did a quick wikipedia search on truffles and apparently they're a ""fungal fruiting body.""

7022,"A commonality that we all share on this magical journey of soul perfection is the awareness that we are continuous students. Many ancient texts make reference to man’s inner yearning to communicate directly with the gods, which many contend is the soul making itself heard and felt. A deep longing as we look into a star lit sky, our imagination drifting to wonder at what is truly out there. To some in recent times, a belief has arisen that earth has been seeded with souls fragments of beings from other galactic species, including angels, ascended masters and even dragons. Mozart was a rare example of his time, a period of enlightenment, but that type of genius is now becoming commonplace. Children are displaying some incredible talents, some observed personally by Drunvalo Melchezidec and writers for OMNI magazine in China. Special schools were even established to train these “super-psychic kids” and their abilities were quite incredible, breaking the laws of physics as we understand them. It has been said that during times of greatest darkness on the earth, a great surge of souls are incarnated. These times of darkness they well recognize as the times of greatest spiritual education and perfection, including the karmic aspects and the chance to balance the scales. At these times, as well, when the Principle of Rhythm takes full effect, it has been quite effectively used as a means to keep the masses unbalanced. But inevitably, as history records the rise and fall and nations, this age will swing back like a pendulum from the dark polarity to that of the Light. NASA confirms that our sun is radiating unknown particles and that there particles “invading” our solar system from a source they cannot determine which are helping to alter our DNA. It would seem we are receiving a helping hand in this ascension process."

Unfortunately, the unsettling moods of both films are undone by the silliness of their narratives, which I have a difficult time ignoring."
7026,"By nature’s arrangement the material body is given to the living entity for his suffering or enjoying. Different types of bodies are acquired for different purposes. The body of a tiger is made for killing and eating raw meat. Similarly, the hogs are made in such a way that they can eat stool. And as human beings our teeth are made for eating vegetables and fruits. All of these bodies are made according to the work done in past lives by the living entity. Our next bodies are being prepared according to the work which we are now doing, but in the previously quoted verse Śrī Kṛṣṇa indicates that one who knows the transcendental nature of His activities becomes free from the reactions of activities. Our activities should be such that we will not again become entangled in this material world. This can be made possible if we become Kṛṣṇa conscious by studying Kṛṣṇa, learning of the transcendental nature of His activities, and understanding how He behaves in this material world and in the spiritual world."

The main aspect I took away with me is that it is almost 100 miles from Calais and, well, a rather rash decision I feel and one which I suspect was very much influenced by Maximilian.

I think it’s great that Emma comes back all ready to take over her life again. But is that really the life she wants? And if so, will that life still be there for her? It’s these questions, and the way that Catherine approaches them, that makes this such a great read."

It is okay to do that here and for some reason when people in FL talk on their cell and drive, their foot comes off of the gas and just kind of hovers there so they aren't really driving so much as gliding, slowly, in the fast lane, GET OUT OF THE WAY ASSHOLE!"

If you feel disconnected from what you once thought of as home, your detachment may be a signal that you are ready to move one. Simply put, you will know you have found your home when both your physical environment and energetic surroundings are in harmony with the individual you are within."
7090,"With the same manner of hesitance as Macbeth when he set off to kill Duncan, Beth rose from her seat to start a long walk to the back of the café where the author of her desires sat. The poet, lost in the scurrying movements of his pen, never looked up from the page at which he stared as Beth’s shy steps approached him. Every unsure footfall brought Beth closer, made the image larger, the whole scene more vivid, the fantasy more real. Staring at the top of James Stevens’s disheveled head, Beth reached the table. James remained lost in his own world. He dropped his pen onto the paper, pulled his hands up to massage his eyes, and then, Beth spoke, “Hello…”"

He manipulates kids, makes them kill their parents, disfigures them, and puts them in his army. He has basically set fire to a reign of terror throughout Uganda. Today, Kony has been pushed back into the Congo. The Invisible Children guys and Jason Russell are extremely dedicated to this cause – fanatically so."

I went for a 4 day motorcycle ride alone. Life changes when you change. Life isn't about everyone that around you. Life is about YOU first, then everything fits.

7121,"As for the stuff that I didn’t like . . . well, I watched a lot of crap this year. I’m going to let some of the direct-to-DVD stuff like The Lazarus Project slide, because no one expects anything from movies like that. And though I saw BOTH Mr. Brooks and The Number 23 this year, I can’t say that they were the worst things I watched, because, like the remake of The Wicker Man, they’re just too funny to hate. However, the latest Body Snatchers movie, The Invasion, was both dull and angry-making, due to the complete cop-out at the end. And I intensely disliked The Darjeeling Limited, production values be damned, because Anderson’s little-boy-lost oeuvre has really started to grate. But for sheer worst of the year? The movie I most likely wouldn’t watch again if you paid me to? National Treasure: Book of Secrets managed to be boring, moronic, entirely too long, and a career low for Helen Mirren. La vie en rose frustrated me so much that I still can’t quite believe I watched the whole thing. But neither of these takes last place, because this year we had the fourth installment of the Indiana Jones franchise. Officially, hands-down, my least favorite movie of the year. Worse than Lost Boys 2!"

7125,"The real hard part is dealing with being imperfect. When we make a mistake, be it raising our voice, making a cutting comment, or making a judgment about our children's needs or wants, we let it consume us. We beat ourselves up, questioning not only our performance in the moment but our fitness as a parent altogether. We lose our ability to be objective about all of the amazing things we do each day, all of the things that create an environment of peace and harmony. We imagine nightmare scenarios about all of the ways we are damaging our children, and we place the blame squarely on our own shoulders, leading to remarkable bouts of self-doubt and feelings of unworthiness. But in doing so, we are forgetting two critical things."

7131,"I spent some time as a child idolizing America’s Founding Fathers. This was in part because I have a genealogical relationship with one and in part because I lived in southern Virginia where, if you want to, you can feel a strong residue of the American Revolution and the early years of the United States all over the place. I certainly did. I learned early on that the state motto, “Sic Semper Tyrannis” or “thus always to tyrants,” was adopted as a direct challenge to King George III and the British Parliament. I was very proud that Virginians wrote the Declaration of Independence (Thomas Jefferson), commanded the Continental Army (George Washington), and crafted the Bill of Rights (James Madison). I enjoyed visiting places like Monticello (the home of Thomas Jefferson), Mt. Vernon (the home of George Washington), Red Hill (the home of Patrick Henry), Colonial Williamsburg, and Yorktown because they gave me the sense that the place where I lived was critically important to the very beginnings of my country’s existence."

This bird cannot help itself. I have to go in there and DO SOMETHING. And do it quickly before more diarrhea escapes and lands on my beautiful leather sofa."

At that point I decided to think of it as a compliment that I have an hourglass (as in pear shaped) figure, and actually NEED something that accentuates my waist. Pooey on these clothing designers if they don't want people looking at their waist, right? RIGHT?!? I mean, I need people to concentrate on my waist to distract from my hip & thigh area. At least I am aware now of what I need for my body and know to blame the clothes for not looking or fitting ""right"" and not to blame my body. Thank you Stacy & Clinton!"

He studied fine art at the Institute of Chicago and graphics at the American Academy of Art, and did advertising work for Pepsi and Buick before switching to book covers. But beyond his commercial career, Bennett was becoming an accomplished and respected painter. In 2008 the RiverSea Gallery in Astoria, Oregon held a restrospective exhibition of Bennett's paintings, to act as a farewell to the local artist, who was moving to the east coast. Follow that link and you'll find a few fine examples of his work, along with a profile which reveals that when Bennett arrived in Oregon in 1986 he experienced something of an artistic epiphany, over the next two decades painting hundreds of pictures of the people and places from the local area."

I stay here for Jewish holidays, for many reasons. But this can make them very hard. The truth is, Pesach, my favorite holiday, ends up being pretty lonely. It feels like you’re on your own, like no one’s around. And you wish more people saw this as home."

Since he didn’t let me give my opinion I will choose now to point out that this is absolutely preposterous. Many, if not all of the Disney ladies are awesome. Yes, some of them are a little more on the girlie side. But my personal opinion is that being girlie isn’t the same thing as being weak. In fact, sometimes it’s just what does the trick."

Lots of things will be the same for Sweet Pea at school this year. She'll be going at the same time of day as last year, five days per week like last year, in the same classroom, with one of the same teachers, and some of the same kids. Some of the other kindergarten-aged kids from last year left to begin attending public schools this year, but Sweet Pea will be one of at least four returning kindergarteners in her classroom. Her two best friends from last year will not be returning - the older one is moving up to the 6-9 year-old room and the younger one will be attending in the morning this year. However, I think this is good for Sweet Pea, especially since some of the other kids will be returning, and there were two in particular she wanted to get to know better. And honestly, while Sweet Pea's 6 1/2-year-old friend is a sweet child, I am glad they will be separated, because the older girl was very bossy and Sweet Pea was her personal little sheep as far as I could tell. I hope that this year Sweet Pea will have more confidence and be more assertive and outgoing and less whispery."

7176,"I'm trying to understand what possible motivation you may have had for publishing that vile cartoon depicting the shooting of the chimpanzee that went crazy. I guess you thought it would be funny to suggest that whomever was responsible for writing the Economic Recovery legislation must have the intelligence and judgment of a deranged, violent chimpanzee, and should be shot to protect the larger community. Really? Did it occur to you that this suggestion would imply a connection between President Barack Obama and the deranged chimpanzee? Did it occur to you that our president has been receiving death threats since early in his candidacy? Did it occur to you that blacks have historically been compared to various apes as a way of racist insult and mockery? Did you intend to invoke these painful themes when you printed the cartoon?"

7178,"Then again, there’s that “love languages” concept, which I don’t find totally idiotic. There’s a kernel of sense in there. Interpreting another person’s style of expressing or feeling love can be a tricky business. Lots of aphorisms apply here; I like “assume positive intent.” That covers a multitude of sins.

NAMA’s action will have put an end to David’s involvement in those talks which he had initiated. Oddly enough Deutsche Bank was the bank cited by Paddy McKillen’s Maybourne group last year as being a candidate to re-finance that group’s loans which were NAMA-bound. According to RTE, the court was told by David’s barrister that he had always had a good relationship with AIB and never missed a payment and ominously perhaps for NAMA, that there were similarities between David’s business and Paddy McKillen’s. Like Paddy, David’s properties generated enough rent to cover interest payments and like Paddy, David had no opportunity to make representations to NAMA before his loans were acquired."

They got about a bit (we're having services in the church rooms during the winter for warmth) and it was very entertaining, they're lovely little children. The girl wanted to take a Communion wafer to her mother. She had her eye on the chalice, I suspect, too, but that was kept firmly away. During the last hymn, she came and fixed me with a beady gaze. I found it hard not to laugh, which isn't ideal with a clarinet. Afterwards, she said ""More, more!"" So, after the service finished, I played another verse of the last hymn and everyone good-humouredly applauded. ""More, more,"" she said again, so I agreed to play one last verse. She asked for more again, but I pointed out that no one could leave until I finished, so it would have to wait until another day. In the kitchen, I rewarded her with a chocolate biscuit. It was terribly flattering. Two encores and asked for a third!"

Borg had created something that Osborne’s critics say does not exist: a self-financing tax cut. ‘There was some criticism at the time that we were borrowing to finance tax cuts,’ he says. But Sweden could do it, because it was expecting to return to surplus soon; Britain has no such luxury, he says. His main advice to Osborne is: ‘Keep on dealing with the deficit, because deficits destroy everything else.’"

Some of the prophets prophesied about events that would take place hundreds of years later (Isaiah prophecies about the fall of Jerusalem in the 700s BC, and this didn’t happen until 586BC). The prophets give God’s perspective on the past, present and future, brought warnings of judgement that were meant to bring sinners to repentance and brought hope of restoration. We can think of the prophets as God’s “policemen.” The people of God had broken the covenant they had made with Him, and the prophets were calling them to repentance, before it was too late and they were judged. Many of the prophets prophesied about exile; Israel was exiled by Assyria in 722BC, and Judah was exiled by Babylon in 586BC."

For example, a miner’s contraction of black lung would be compensable in all states. However, an employee in an office with a co-worker who smokes would not be eligible for workers’ compensation for treatment of illness due to secondhand smoke."

Instead I wish to take a look at Independence at home. And when I say home I literally mean home. Home being where ever you live. If living in your home there happen to be children then I have a question for you. Why are there labels for children that include ""terrible"" when referring to the ages 2 or 3 or teen years? Well my guess is it because during those ages and probably most ages those children are expressing independence. Within the pictures of the fireworks I have included in this post I can see beauty. Yet when there are fireworks at home parents often complain about the ways in which their children are expressing their independence. If you celebrate independence today and then the rest of the year spend much of your time as a parent controlling almost every aspect of your children's lives I might go so far as to brand you a hypocrite. I challenge you to look at your parenting and recognize when you are fighting for your independence instead of celebrating your children's expression of independence. I'd be interested in hearing the comments of readers and how they celebrate their children's Independence."

Groom-to-be Jason comes from a working-class African-American family, and his mother doesn’t take super kindly to the parents of bride-to-be Sabrina, who are also African-American but live in a gigantic mansion and speak French and shit. The title of the movie comes from a clash between the two families—Jason’s mother wants the pair to “jump the broom” at their wedding, a Black American tradition that involves newlyweds jumping over a ceremonial (but literal) broom. (Since slaves couldn’t actually get married, they would jump the broom to symbolize their union.) Jason’s family has done it for generations; Sabrina’s was too busy being rich and speaking French. Cue conflict."

I have become really ambivalent about this wonderful season meant for celebrating my Savior’s birth. Sadly and invariably, I experience less savior and more stress. It’s just occurring to me that doing nothing is not the answer to doing too much which I used to do with incredibly disastrous results.

The highlight of this part was taking the switchbacks to cross the mountains. When I finally did get to Ho in the early afternoon, I couldn’t find the guesthouse I was looking for and got lost. Ended up taking a wrong turn and riding through the Ho market on market day, which was an intense experience.

7321,"The major cost in developing FDCs, is the clinical trials, especially for drugs aiming for the WHO pre-qualification regulatory approvals. A seal of approval from WHO would mean that the drug will be bought in bulk by the several international aid agencies that carry out anti-malarial programs in Africa and Southeast/South Asia where malaria is rampant. Once the cost of clinical trials is covered by the DST, it is unlikely that Ranbaxy would have had to invest any significant sum in the development of the drug. Public private partnerships such as this negate the need for monopoly IP measures such as patents or data exclusivity, since the public sector is in effect subsidizing the private sector in drug development. It is also not the first time that somebody proposed this model of developed. Jerome Reichman, for instance has long called for a ‘public goods’ approach clinical trials where the cost is borne by the government in a bid to reduce demands for monopoly IP protections by pharmaceutical companies.

Each of the shadows I'm reviewing are a different degree of shimmer/glittery-ness due to the colour/glitter combo. This shade is actually quite sparkly, with very fine shimmer particles. However they are ever so subtle when you apply it on your eyelids. It is a perfect crease colour, but can also be used really well as the main base shadow for a sultry smokey eye. Since the eyeshadow is really fine and powdery, it's very easy to blend."

In the same manner that the great hunt for the next buried ""psychedelic"" record has led us to describe some very bubblegum discs as being ""popsike"", the desperation for new nuggets in a heavily mined genre led to similar behaviour with old soul music in the seventies. The numerous snide YouTube comments under videos of tracks describing themselves as ""Northern Soul"" these days points towards the fact that a great many punters were disgruntled by this activity (and remain so) but it didn't seem to hurt ticket sales for the nights at the time."

7466,"There’s also the question of how much value an entry in the GBG will be to a Wetherspoon’s. In practice, I would say very little. I recognise that some are far better than others in terms of beer quality, beer range and ambiance, but I’d say if you’re inclined to go in Spoons and find yourself in a strange town, you’ll probably go in anyway, and if you’re not you’ll still stay away. And they don’t tend to hide their light under a bushel down alleyways and in back streets. If the beer’s good, you may stay for another, and when you get back to the hotel note that the pub was in the GBG, but it probably won’t influence your decision in the first place. Therefore, from a personal perspective, listing any Spoons is a waste of space – I expect the Guide to lead me to places that I might not otherwise have found."
7467,"I would say, second, that we have a real obligation to recognize that, if you’re truly faithful, it’s not just an hour on Sundays or Saturdays or Fridays.

7472,"The common assumption that monsters are frightening, and that they frighten human beings, and that the reverse situation never occurs, was conclusively disproved by the opening of the Imperial Monster Museum in 1866, a public facility where unique cryptozoological exhibits could be viewed for a nominal sum. The rooms were filled with monsters that had literally petrified from fright after catching sight of a human face. These stone behemoths, sciapods, harpies, colossi, minotaurs, gorgons, cynocephali, onocentaurs and other mythical beasties were arranged randomly after the directors of the museum disagreed on how best to categorise them. The Imperial Monster Museum was closed in 1899 and the exhibits sold at private auction to statue enthusiasts."

7477,"The rest of the pilot episode is centered around introducing the viewer to the various characters that are going to be major players on the show. It looks like Coach Taylor’s wife and daughter will feature prominently along with the quarterback, running back, and fullback. I found it interesting that no real attention was given to a wide receiver, but that’s just a casual observation. There also appear to be the requisite female characters of the cheerleader who is dating the quarterback and the “bad girl” type that seems to only be interested in causing trouble. My favorite character from the episode was the backup quarterback Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford)."
7478,"Those words broke Young Miss's heart. She hung up the phone and wept for hours.

7489,"It's sad that the only thing that gets me to a Terry Gilliam film these days is a rare (well, somewhat rare - he's also apparently in The Book of Eli, also coming out this month) performance by Tom Waits. I used to love Gilliam, and some of his films - Brazil in particular - will always be among my favorites. But over the last fifteen years or so, ever since the questionable success of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (no one else could have adapted the book quite so well, but it was pretty much a bomb at the box office), Gilliam has gone down his own rabbit hole, bouncing back and forth between sloppy, more mainstream films like The Brothers Grimm and equally troubled personal projects such as Tideland. Parnassus has elements of both. It's got the star power and a scope that tries to play to the rafters, but the themes - about the power of choice and imagination - are pure Gilliam. Unfortunately, it's also a total mess."

7509,"While Ichigo’s body is becoming covered in the Hollow “material” (?), he begins to have a vision of a strange man in a cape in a world of boxes. The man tries to tell him his name but Ichigo is unable to hear it. Suddenly, the world begins to dissolve around Ichigo and the man implores him to find the box with his shinigami powers (at which point Ichigo remembers Ishida’s story about how shinigami‘s soul ribbons are red). Ichigo finds the hilt of his zanpakuto (though not the blade). In a massive explosion, he destroys the giant implement Tessai was going to use to kill him and emerges out of the pit in his shinigami robe. He also has a Hollow mask on but with one quick bash of his sword’s hilt, Ichigo is back to his normal bad-ass self. He passes his second test and now must do his third and final one which is to knock the hat off of Uruhara’s head who draws his own zanpakuto (which means he’s hiding something about himself). Uruhara nearly kills Ichigo when Ichigo sees his zanpakuto‘s spirit again and finally learns the swords name, zangetsu. It becomes a massive sword whose type I can’t really name and Ichigo easily (in one swing) knocks off Uruhara’s hat (and would have killed Uruhara if he hadn’t put up a shield). Seven days later (after Chad, Orihime, and Ichigo all say goodbye to their families), they return to Uruhara’s shop one last time (along with Uryu) to finally enter Soul Society. Uruhara has created a massive portal but he gives them a dire warning. They only have four minutes to make it through. Any more and they’ll be stuck between the world’s forever and thus they head out with Yoruichi as their guide."

Logan kills his former friend and returns to the city with the old man, proof that you don’t have to die at 30. But, you can still dial up sex partners if you want."

7518,"My decision to take the DM course was not easily made but it’s looking better and better. I have yet to recieve any offers to work in the nursing field and the long it is before I get a CNA job the less likely it will be that I will get an RN position before we leave the island. We have been here about 16 months which means we will only really be here about another 18 months or so. So, if it takes me a year to get into a nursing job, after the 12 week training, I would only hold the job 6 months. The employers are not blind to this. In fact, I’m starting to suspect that it’s already in the front of their minds."

7520,"I must jump in my reflections to May. After my first flirtation with poetry, I spent almost all of my time writing essays and stories. I was still in this mindset in May, but I thought I would post this poem because it was the very first manifestation of a fascination with the sky that would lead to an obsession that resulted in my first submission to ""Poetry."" You can see a slight increase of skill, but since I was still a very green poet, it is quite raw."

The vibrations are strong enough to work well through clothes but quiet enough to not be heard through doors and walls. The fact that it’s waterproof will make bathtime playtime, if water sports is what you’re into. Just make sure the silicone plug is properly plugged and don’t use any bath oils as this could deteriorate the silicone."
7532,"I think it should be clear to the discerning reader that I would side with Henghis—not that I consider him an epitome, but he is, at least, a civilized being. What comes after him is definitely a rough beast.

7536,"Here's the thing. My goal weight is 130. It's a weight I look really good at. However, it's kind of hard for me to get to/maintain it. So I've realized that I am okay with not being at 130 all year. As long as I'm not above 145, I am still at a very healthy weight, and I still look...decent. This past month I've been wavering between 137 and 141, due to all the holiday treats and scaling back a little on the exercise, and that's been okay. At this time of year I'm just covered in sweaters and pants 24/7 anyway. But I do want to make sure that I am at 130 when the summer starts, and all throughout it, because I want to be able to wear all the stuff I want without worrying about how my body looks. In order to do this I'll make sure to really buckle down on my diet and up the exercise starting in March, so that I'll have plenty of time to hit my goal by summer. Of course this doesn't mean I won't be exercising and eating well the rest of the year, it just means I won't be torturing myself if I don't look perfect."
7537,"Power Distance scores are high for Latin, Asian and African countries and smaller for Anglo and Germanic countries, and correlates with the use of violence in domestic politics and income inequality. Uncertainty Avoidance scores are higher in Latin countries, in Japan, and in German speaking countries, lower in Anglo, Nordic, and Chinese culture countries. UAI scores correlate with Roman Catholicism and with the legal obligation in developed countries for citizens to carry identity cards. Individualism scores are high in developed and Western countries, while collectivism prevails in less developed and Eastern countries; Japan takes a middle position on this dimension. Individualism is correlated with national wealth and mobility between social classes. Masculinity Index is high in Japan, in some European countries like Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and moderately high in Anglo countries; it is low in Nordic countries and in the Netherlands and moderately low in some Latin and Asian countries like France, Spain and Thailand. Masculinity scores correlate negatively with the percent of women in democratically elected governments.

On this piece, I laid it on top of a canvas prepared with extra heavy gesso and smeared (okay, I'm having an elder moment here, can't remember the real name of the medium) a product that is supposed to dry to the texture of watercolor paper. The different texture didn't make much difference in the finished product, but it was an interesting experiment anyway."

Equally practice encourages the parasympathetic nervous system to do its job, namely relax the bodymind complex. The asanas if well taught will trigger various nerve centres particularly in the lumbar spine, pelvis and pelvic floor if relaxed enough a woman can orgasm. The female orgasm is a complex matter. Truth be known yoga can make a person feel extremely orgasmic in themselves, this is when the yoga student is moving away from yoga as a form of exercise and yoga as it is truly meant meaning Union with the self, I am not surprised many women actually orgasm when they relax enough to meet themselves."

7565,"Movies featuring guys I find funny and for the most part are funny, but definitely aren’t ground breaking at all. Horrible Bosses would have been way better had it gone much further with the bad behavior of the bosses. I kind of feel like they did it with the Kevin Spacey character, but the other two were bad but didn’t really warrant the crazy level of hatred. They were definitely bad, manipulative people, but MURDER material? I’m not sure. Our Idiot Brother was largely predictable, but had some funny scenes. Especially the ones featuring the hippie boyfriend of Paul Rudd’s ex. That dude brought this one up at least a category."

Perhaps I’m not getting real and viewing all this trough rose tinted, old fashion spectacles however to me there was always something specially about the FA Cup final it always had centre stage, ie no other games taking place, and the build up, be cup final knockout, meet the teams or even wheeling out Jimmy Tarbuck for his traditional pre match interview, was part and parcel of the whole event. Now it has gone or has the innocence of my youth?"
7571,"Whatever the reason, their relationship is thought provoking on two different levels. The first is in the psychological ramifications of their forbidden love. The second is in the cultural clash that the two create. Davis is a beacon of Western Christian morality; chaste, forgiving, selfless. General Yen represents the Chinese Hollywood stereotypes of the early 1930s; greedy, conniving, and ruthless. Davis is an idealist who believes that with God’s help any problem can be resolved. General Yen is a callous pragmatist who understands that whoever has the money and the weapons has the power. Throughout the film they try to convert each other to their own ways of thinking. But each instance fails."

7601,"N- detects in ‘community values’ or ‘the utility of the herd’, a situation at once self-contradictory and absurd. He does not think that one can have a genuine situation of ‘neighbor love’ in a communal situation, as love is one of the ‘strong drives’ and can only be embodied by a ‘high and independent’ spirit. Opposed to this, N- thinks, is the society which values community, as this can only be founded in a system of ‘neighbor fear’, fear that one’s neighbor might do something: either become ‘criminal’ or conversely, do something to ‘rise above’ the herd; both of which are considered ‘immoral’ to a communal society. I think he sees this as the way most people run most (modern) societies most of the time, and his chief critique of these types of living arrangements are that it stultifies. That it considers that which he values (will to power, etc.) as criminal, as ‘branded and slandered most’. ‘Everything that elevates and individual above teh herd and intimidates the neighbor is henceforth called evil.’ That they co-opt and abuse moral rhetoric to enforce their ‘peaceful conditions’, and above all their ‘mediocrity‘. In such a society, only a ‘sheep, gains in respect’. These societies seem to N- to consider as their imperitive ‘”we want that some day there should be nothing any more to be afraid of!”…is now called “progress”.’ N-’s tastes appear to run counter."

The only difference is that this latest story was not made through words, but from ideas made into action. After all, they all come from just one source and it is to that source that all these stories lead. Too often I’ve felt that most of my life went on to be unwritten, but they’re actually still there. What I need to do is to acknowledge they exist so that they can come to life, and then perhaps I will be free."

The outcome is not always uplifting. This film has the admirable courage to show this tough side of giving back."

Yes, we had a cleaning woman (and right about now, two of my friends are doing their best Steve Martin impression from his movie Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid), but I would contend (or rationalize) that having a person come by once a week to clean is different from a person who stops by every day to cook dinner, do laundry, mop the floors, buy groceries, and do whatever else needs to be done."

Well, they were existing, but I don’t know of any who claimed to have masterminded attacks (Please I stand to be corrected). I revere the man Obasanjo for this singular reason which is grand to me. His domineering and somewhat autocratic style of leadership is enviable. Did you notice how he even talked to his governors during economic summits? “Governor Akwa Ibom, do you think we are here to joke?” As though the governors were his sons. After all, aren’t they? This charisma, guts and his aggressive mind of his is obviously traced not to his military background only but also as a war lord! Who the hell are you Boko Haram in the presence of the man who captured the Biafra war (Colonel Obasanjo of 3rd Marine Commando Division!)?"

I choose to err on the side of grace even when it is inconvenient, unfair, or unsavory. I choose to err on the side of grace because when I look at the Biblical story, that is what I see my God doing time and again. Yes, there are moments of God’s judgment. Surely there are warnings of dire consequences as a result of sin. But I believe that the story of God’s redeeming love, mercy and forgiveness permeates the entire Bible."

In the distance, you can see the Atlantic & Yadkin Greenway Bridge. The view is well worth a look. Although the trail continues to follow the shoreline closely, I didn’t find any completely unobstructed views. But I could hear the rumble created by bikers and runners crossing the former railway bridge. Once you hear that rumble from the trail, you can pretty well pick your spot to get a closer look at the bridge, keeping in mind that you will probably be peering over some underbrush and through some low hanging branches.

She was beautiful with a slender frame and delicate features, and she also had 'lotus feet' achieved by binding and breaking bones when she was a toddler - an operation carried out by her mother. As I have mentioned before bound feet were supposed to be erotic and Jung Chang explains why. Men were supposed to find the helpless way of walking, and the woman's child-like dependency arousing some kind of protective feeling in the man. Youthful features are generally thought to be sexually attractive - it is thought to be one reason why blondes have more fun, and women constantly strive to look slim. All these features mimic the young of our species - and maybe the attraction of the new and unsullied. Maybe, in some way, the bound feet were associated with virginity."

That, along with the expansion and the cost of it's recent legal battles—including two trademark lawsuits and an dispute between Anchor Brewery over a former employee, above and beyond the shareholder lawsuit—have weighed heavily on the brewery. Somewhere along the line, Bell also seem to have forgotten his children, and has made no contingency plan for them—as far as his business goes.

The next workout is a 10-minute segment with Jillian, using a lot of the same moves from her ’30 Day Shred’. It is a great addition to the first one for an added challenge. The third workout is with Ajay Rochester and is also 10 minutes long. I find this one boring and not as challenging as the others. Being that it’s the third workout, I guess I thought it would be really hard, but it’s not. It requires less movement than the other two, and is a lot more repetitive. That said, beginners might like it."

7706,"2. (S) The signals became unmistakable in late November that the GOE is preparing for increased military involvement in Somalia. PM Meles’ speech to Parliament November 23 (ref A) laid out the GOE’s justification for action to counter the ""clear and present danger"" posed by the CIC. Meles’ contentions that 1) the CIC had already declared war (jihad) on Ethiopia; and 2) the CIC had already violated Ethiopian sovereignty by arming and transporting OLF and ONLF fighters across the border formed the heart of this justification. In private, Meles has referred consistently to the end of the rains in Somalia as the trigger for Ethiopian limited military operations against the CIC. Weather forecasts suggest that the rain may taper off beginning the week of Dec. 4, allowing ground-based operations to begin once the terrain dries. DATT believes that the ENDF, which is just emerging from a 10-days commanders conference, is prepared to launch operations roughly one week after rains have ended, if the order is given. All source intelligence has shown a steady build-up of Ethiopian military assets, including tanks, artillery, troop transport and other heavy equipment on both sides of Ethiopia’s border with southern Somalia. Air assets including attack helicopters have not yet moved within range of their likely targets, but appear poised for action just outside the immediate theater, ready to move when the signal is given. Post’s best estimate is that the ENDF will be poised to launch their offensive approximately in the latter part of December. Scheduled CIC-TFG talks in Nairobi and Khartoum mid-month might prompt the GOE to delay if there is reason to believe that the CIC might change and engage more seriously in such talks. Deputy Foreign Minister Tekeda’s Dec. 1 talks with CIC representatives in Djibouti (ref B) represent a last-ditch effort to change CIC behavior without resorting to war."

Soon afterwards we noticed that this accountant, a woman called Miss Wilcock, was turning up for regular meetings, always scheduled when Cécile, the ringmaster’s wife, was out on some errand. It wasn’t difficult to guess what was going on, and one of the girls confirmed the obvious by sneaking over to the bungalow during one of these trysts and listening to the ringmaster grunting like an overheated warthog."

I knew what field I wanted to enter when I was 14 so I joined the newspaper staff, then went to journalism school, and now I’m a freelance writer and editor. One might argue that I just have a personality type that lends itself to long-term relationships in general. However, I believe my commitment to skating taught me how to stay committed to people and goals. Skating, like life, can have its ups and downs, but that doesn’t mean I’m just going to give up on it. And skating has touched my heart in a way that means I’ll never let it go. I believe that because of that experience, I am better able to recognize good things when they come along and better able to hold onto them and nurture them as part of my life. These relationships, like my relationship with skating, have yielded me infinite joy back compared with the joy and love I put into them, which just fills me up with even more love to reciprocate with. It’s a beautiful cycle and part of life to learn, and it makes the rough patches of life all the more bearable."

There's a twist and the book and film deal with the twist very differently, but appropriately for their medium. I did see the twist coming in the film and if I had read the book first, would not have done and the book dealt with it so perfectly, simply, abruptly. I cry at a lot of romantic films but I properly cried from the twist to the end. I was pretty distraught as the end and needed a minute."

7830,"Once the Hoxie wagon company began their westward trek, everything seemed to be faring well. The weather seemed beautiful. Everyone seemed to be in good spirits – including the black family from Illinois named Jones that managed to join the wagon train without any opposition. Both Naomi and Rachel attracted the romantic attention of the train’s two scouts – ‘Skate’ Guthrie and James ‘Jim’ Ebbets (Ryan Robbins and Christopher Heyerdahl). This contentment finally ended when Thunder Heart Woman spotted wolves feeding off the corpse of a buffalo and when the train later crossed what I believe was the Big Blue River. The incident proved to be the first of two disagreements between the couple. Thunder Heart Woman viewed the wolves as a sign that the wagon train would come to a bad end. She insisted that the Wheeler family return to Missouri. Jacob dismissed her worries as superstition on her part. But the expression on his face clearly indicated his doubts on the wisdom of the trip."

The diagnosis came with a bit of relief (ok, not gonna lie, AFTER I bawled my eyes out) because I knew this had gone on too long, with too little relief even though I'd done everything in theory that should relieve a calf strain. I'll be 100% honest here, I have suspected a stress fracture for a while now. I put it out of my head at first because according to my research, a fracture that high up seemed to be pretty rare. The spot that hurt (the one spot where I had a pinpoint pain) was the same exact spot that hurts due to patellar tendonitis. Therefore, I chalked it up to PT, even though my wonderful knee strap not only did NOT alleviate it, it made it hurt worse. (Well, no wonder. I was putting a tight strap right over a fracture.

Considering he is specializing as a Maxillofacial Surgeon, it's not surprising that he noticed it and I never did. He told me that I needed to get it checked out, so that I did. Jan. 2010 I went to my primary doctor and did blood work for my thyroid. It all came back fine. Feb. I had an ultrasound which mainly just showed that my left thyroid was very very large. March I had a biopsy (horrible thing to have done especially if you have bad experiences with needles) and in April I found out the results were benign. I thought I should go to a specialist, but my doctor told me I didn't need to and everything looked fine. He said it didn't matter that it was so large. I was supposed to go back the next year. Well that next year I was going to go back then ended up getting pregnant, was horribly sick with the pregnancy and then lost the baby at 18 weeks (which I have been told by all my Doctors that my thyroid and now cancer was not the reason for losing the baby). My point is that I didn't end up going into the doctor that year because of all that went on with me. So Jan. of this year I made an appointment with my primary doctor and told them I was coming in for a referral. I didn't want to be told that I didn't need to go to a specialist. I was told by SO many other people that I certainly DID need to go to a specialist, and I felt I needed to, so I finally took matters into my own hands."

When I look back on it, I always think I should have probably kept her in Montessori school for one more year before she started kindergarten, but that's just one more of those parenting decisions I can't change now."
7963,"I'm down to 74 Twitter followees. Twitter is basically the exact opposite of Facebook. I only follow people I don't know. Or, more specifically, I follow ""famous"" people. Some celebrities (Tom Hanks, Steve Martin), some comedians (Daniel Tosh, Mike Birbiglia), some athletes (Brandon Phillips, A.J. Green), but mostly, I follow sports personalities (sports writers, announcers). Twitter is great for real-time online conversation. And nothing is more real-time than major sporting events. I have fun interacting with well-known sportswriters. Often, they respond. And I get most breaking news from Twitter. I heard about the deaths of Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston from Twitter. Before full stories are written, Tweets are sent. So, I don't follow anyone I actually know on Twitter because Facebook is better equipped for that type of relationship. I rarely Tweet anything unless I'm Tweeting @ a specific person. "

After struggling to nickle and dime it for years they hooked up with a professional promoter, rented a gymnasium, had us dress up in our dress uniforms, and once a week we had the biggest, baddest Bingo around. Big jackpots, refreshments, professional callers, and firefighters selling bingo sheets ... it was a hit. Such a hit that we started running out of room to seat people."

7971,"“My father and Mr. Hatfield, a neighbor, would wait until there was about six inches of clear ice, usually in February. Dad would bring our team and wagon alongside the pond and, using the same crosscut saw we used for winter wood, cut the ice in big slabs. They slid the ice up 4x4s onto the wagon, then took it to the ice house, which was adjacent to the road. After about three or four loads, the ice house was filled. More straw was placed amongst the ice blocks and laid on top.”"

SO powerful that I now am determined to to finish reading the book (within my lifetime). If anyone has read it, please leave a comment, and tell me how great this novel is."
7973,"This time of year, it can be a challenge for many in Michigan to be able to make a local salad. I'm blessed to live in Ann Arbor, where we have one of the best farmer's markets around. It's a year round market and it's a producers-only market, which means that all of our wonderful items are grown, baked or crafted by the vendors who sell them. It used to be only a few of the farmers had hoop houses to be able to grow produce in the winter time...I can remember having to be at the market no later than 7 am just to be able to get a bag of Shannon Brines greens to make a local salad in the depths of winter. But now, thanks largely to a great group of people involved Four Season Farm Development Program, we have a lot more vendors that can provide salad fixings at the market, which is great!"

Talking about a peace conference now is not really the point. Or people say, as with the cop facing the murderous bank robber, “Don’t shoot him. We need to clean up the neighborhood so that the people have jobs and don’t turn to crime.” Again, great, yes, that’s true. We have to create a situation where there aren’t criminals in that neighborhood, but right now I’ve got an armed robber in the bank and he’s threatening to kill his hostages. So, right now I have to protect the citizens of my state, and if I don’t fire at any of the houses that have children on the roof, then I won’t be able to protect my civilians. And that’s unthinkable, out of the question."

First off was Amorino, with locations scattered all around the city, most of which we judiciously visited. Unfortunately, Amorino's foreign customer service needs serious improvement. While we were greeted with impatient rudeness each time we went, our friend -a local - flirtatiously chatted with the servers and got a custom, tulip-shaped, gelato for his efforts. If I had been born a handsome French male, I would have turned up the charm as well, but as it was the interactions between server and customer were perilous during our stay in Paris*."

You can get there by train or by De Lijn, but the train is faster. From Brussel there are direct trains to Liedekerke. From there it is a 20 minute walk along the seemingly never-ending Stationstraat. Iddergem station (make sure not to confuse it with Idegem station on the same line; believe me, the only facility there while waiting for the train back is a frituur café) is closer, but you will have to change trains at Denderleeuw. The next big railway project may well bring it even closer. Inspired by the Parisian RER, the GEN - a regional express network around Brussels - is being built. My hope is that whilst bringing beer tourists easier to Liedekerke and around in Payottenland, the network does not challenge this unique part of Vlaanderen with its rich beer culture."

But the girl made a fatal flaw. When one of the games gave her a single ticket…..she gave it to Isabel. Hence, the beginning of the stalking. The girl was so nice to Isabel and didn’t seem to mind in the least, and for that I thanked her. She gave Isabel 14 tickets, and Isabel knew exactly what to do with them. How I don’t know….must be something in kid DNA that just tells them. Kind of like that part of your brain that makes you breathe automatically.

Donna resists and instead searches for what she wants out of life. She finds her passion in a funeral home, putting makeup on dead people, as the title says. Throughout the story there is fighting with her mom about everything. In the end acceptance does occur even with their separate ideas on how they should live their lives.

We have a basement... so Chris and I boxed everything that was lose and moved all the smaller bits of furniture (and some bigger bits) down there... but yes, we were having the basement re-carpetted too but I told the guys that they would have to do the top two floors first and then do the basement carpet on the last day once we had a chance to put things back into the 'done' areas. See, good planning eh? ;) Hmmmm, end of day one they had completed the carpets in the bedrooms and lounge and part of the stairs and tell me they are doing the basement next!!

Once more the fight for supremacy was between Senna’s McLaren Honda and Prost, who had swapped seats with Berger and moved to McLaren’s closest rivals Ferrari. For the third successive year, Japan was the deciding point for the championship saga. This time it was Prost who needed to win to keep his title dream alive. Senna took his customary pole position but bitterly complained all weekend that pole position was on the dirtier side of the grid. He campaigned for it to be changed and Prost actually agreed. The officials granted Senna’s request, but Balestre refused to back down. Consequently Senna vowed that if Prost turned into turn one first, he would regret it."

Jim has permission to use the boat on the lake that is essentially in our front yard and, so, Jim and this man were out fishing. I immediately started with the questions: Does the man have a scraggly beard? Is he really skinny? Is he wearing a baseball cap? A t-shirt with a front pocket? Yep, yep, yep and yep. And has teeth are a bit funky. That’s it. The baby blue with a trowel in the back was a dead giveaway. I knew it, though I didn’t want to know it.

It is the materialistic item that officially symbolizes our split and it's kind of strange. The first offer we ever got had me jumping in excitement and immediately after, in tears! It was such a bittersweet moment. That offer fell through, among a few others, and I've had time to adjust to really selling the home and letting it go. This time around felt a bit different, almost like I'm more ready to let it go. The people that are buying the house are so sweet too, and I think that really helps.

We use ponzu in Hawaii so this wasn’t anything new, but I’ve never had ponzu with my tonkatsu before. My coworkers said it was there to “enhance” the oily taste, to make it smoother. They were right–it still tasted like something fried but there was a different quality to it.

With the return to normal trading, the leading Czech, German, Danish and Dutch lagers are available in those bars that hold varied stocks. Important differences in brewing practice have already been noted. A fairly high percentage of maize flakes and a more light cured pale ale barley malts are used for light lagers, whilst dark lagers of the Munich type have many qualities of light stouts. The decoction method of mashing and very light hopping with bottom fermentation are the general rule. After the first stages of fermentation the beer is left to mature in 'lagers' or storage tanks for as long as a year. Attenuation is as high as eighty percent."

8106,"I tend to speak my mind plainly when I speak it, and when I don’t, I war with myself about when to speak and when not to speak, and end up saying nothing. I become embarrassed pretty easily. (I detest being the center of attention, though that probably isn’t evident when I’m up to my mischief.) I dislike being “sized up” and judged, so before I know a person, I don’t give away much about myself. Sometimes I’m still shy with private information even when I know a person, but if they figure it out and make me laugh over it, I generally become deeply close to them pretty quickly. I love being called out for my temper — or for anything really. I respect that. I am irrationally protective sometimes. If I was taller I’d jump into street fights, but that would be foolish given my size. Still, my temper can go from cool to scolding in a moment, when I see an underdog being attacked. I have been trying lately to temper that temper of mine, because honestly, I rarely belong in the middle of things. I just hop in because I want to outshout the shouter."

My mental health had really started to decline, and I was having a very hard time being locked up in what I considered to be a prison-like environment. Sure, I had some very wonderful nurses to keep me company and I had round the clock medical care in case something went wrong, but there's something incredibly difficult about being stuck in the same bed, in the same room for days upon days. I really tried to make the best of the situation, and I knew I was doing the right thing for my girls, but slowly I was finding myself sinking into a major funk--and after one particularly bad evening where I contemplated backhanding the night nurse and making a run for it, I was convinced that Antepartum room 3B was going to be the death of me."

During our visit, we saw many workers performing maintenance and restoration work, including removing plant growth from between stone work, repairing mortar, and (along with several llama) trimming grass. Machu Picchu is the largest tourist attraction inPeru and concerns have risen over the impact of so many visitors to this ancient site. The government has set restrictions on development in the area and just last year started restricting the number of daily visitors. There have been attempts to construct a helipad in the area but the Peruvian government has yet to approve such a plan. In fact, there is a no-fly-zone over the site."

And I decided on a stronger light source this time and from a definite direction. If this little charmer's blond hair doesn't point you the right direction of my light source, I really failed. LOL I also see now why some Copics coloring champions also use pencils to deepen the darkest edges. Getting what should be dark crevices the right color is going to take (much) more practice, but I'm happy with what I've learned so far.

My mom and her 3 sisters would all gather in the tiny kitchen to help prepare dinner but the dressing making was reserved for E. (I must insert that my mom is the wind beneath my wings. Another post later.) E. worked very hard at her job in the hospital. She didn’t drive so when we’d go visit, we’d pick her up from work. She’d come out in her little pink jacket. Back in the day, that kind of seemed out of the norm to me because most women her age didn’t work outside the home. I guess in my mind, a grandma was supposed to be sitting in a rocking chair knitting. But she knew what she needed to do to survive and a survivor she was! She was well liked by her coworkers and a friend to many. I still remember her laughter even though her mind and body were stressed with the cares of life. Lord, help me remember to laugh even in hard times. E. Banks was faithful to God and family. She was grateful for her blessings."

8212,"Just as Jo overcame the temptation to write sensation stories just for the money, so Alcott did in her own life, with her writing material reflecting this progression. Elizabeth Keyser in a brief biographical introduction of Louisa May Alcott’s Work, describes Alcott’s works from her early sensation stories to her final success as a children’s author. She touches on Alcott’s unfamiliar adult works, like Moods,saying that they “had been roughly treated by both its publisher and the reading public,” indicating the resistance Alcott received when she attempted to assert herself as an adult writer. In Alcott’s efforts to portray the truth of woman’s search for independence, “her candid treatment of adultery and divorce as alternatives to unhappy marriage,”(72) she found not to be lucrative to either pocketbook or soul. Though Alcott tried her hand at adult literature, she was satisfied with the fact that her fortune and name was made in her children’s literature, which has endeared the hearts of children of all ages for generations."

Luckily the weather has been nice (by Oregon standards) and I have not been overly bombarded by rain while walking to work in the afternoon and evenings. Initially, I was a bit unsettled by walking home alone late at night, but the streets are lit enough and, while I don’t know Karate, I do know kuh-razy and I will use it. Though my ferocious tendencies often come in handy, I feel safe enough walking on well lit roads on my own. Thus far, it doesn’t seem like something that could potentially be a problem."
8229,"I watch a lot of horror. Not only do I love it, but my boyfriend loves it, so you can imagine how many movies we’ve gone through. Cabin in the Woods is indeed a “game-changer”—more precisely, it’s a genre-changer. Whedon excels at mixing genres, and he was one of the first to do it on television with Buffy, which blended drama, comedy, romance, horror … and occasionally musicals. Cabin in the Woods is so fresh because it breaks the conventions of horror—instead of the Big Bad getting the best of the good guys, the good guys get the best of the Big Bad, and that’s only scratching the surface."

From a gamer’s perspective, however, there’s a fair bit to be excited about. Surprisingly though, this article is not going to focus on the absolutely gargantuan number of titles that are about to flood store shelves in time for the Christmas rush, nor will it be a rant on how annoying I find the Call of Duty franchise (though I really must write about that sometime). Instead, the headline act for me this month is just one particular game, Sonic Generations – a joyous celebration of 20 years of Sonic the Hedgehog – but more specifically, how nostalgia plays such a big role in today’s society."

While a good 60% of the party didn’t vote for him, 90% or more are prepared to vote for him in the November election. Moreover 90% of the party views him as the legitimate GOP nominee. He won fair and square.That the Ronulans want to pretend like there’s any shot at winning in Tampa is the height of absurdity. That they think Paul can win with an underhanded and illegitimate stealth delegate campaign shows where these people are coming from."

He talked about the potential in Pakistan, but also about the challenges that lay ahead - something the others missed completely. The one thing all goras brought up that was echoed by our beloved Pakistani panelists was the level of philanthropy in in the country, and how it was unrivaled anywhere in the world. I strongly agree with this point, as Pakistanis as a people have very open hearts, and are always willing to give to a good cause, even the middle income folks struggling to cope with rampant inflation in the country. The problem is a lot of this money is misdirected. If we can better utilize this trait of Pakistani, perhaps get the nation to believe in a system where tax goes to development rather than lining the pockets of the corrupt, we could have something. It was nice to hear though people with experience from all over the world, singling out the philanthropy of Pakistanis as something that inspires them."

I should be able to level the figures a bit and not just rely on the insomniac late night internet wander to fuel my views counter. Without reinventing the wheel, so to speak, I think the best way to grow your known followers is to find networks you have not broken into yet. Sure, I could continuously post on my Facebook about the blog, but people will get weary of it and start to desensitize to anything I have to post, and at worst click the little “x” to block all my Facebook updates.

In fact, it was such a drain on his finances that Barbara Stanwyck warned Sturges, ""That goddamned greasy spoon is ruining you!"" The Players reached its zenith during the war years, with restaurants operating on all three levels and a barbershop on the mezzanine. A dinner theater/dance floor featuring a hydraulic revolving stage was installed and eventually even a hamburger stand was added. And there was the long-standing rumor that Sturges had gone to the trouble of building a tunnel beneath Marmont Lane connecting The Players to the Chateau so celebrities could slip away discreetly - for clandestine affairs or simply to avoid the press and/or the police."

Whether it’s enjoying a new culture through its music, traditions, and clothing at a playful luau, or watching a square bubble wand form circular bubbles no matter how they blow them (then asking why this continuously happens), playing is how children learn new things. In a way, playing is children’s form of work (think about how tired you are after a day’s work, and how tired our kids can be after a full day at preschool – both are mentally and physically taxing!)."

Disappointingly there was no sign of a suitable baptism in the IGI, and a trawl of microfilms of the parish registers for All Saints, St Werburgh, St Alkmund, St Michael and St Peter between 1760 and 1765, kindly carried out for me by Frank Wattleworth, also turned up empty. Spreading the net (and the fishing euphemisms) a little wider, both location- and time-wise, produced a baptism for an Edward Foster on 13 November 1774 at Egginton, a parish seven miles to the south-west of Derby, the son of Edward and Anne Foster."

Jesus ascended into heaven. Moses got the Red Sea to rise up so the Jews could escape from the pharaoh. Genghis Khan and his Mongol hordes were able to invade and defeat rival civilizations because they rode on flying horses."
8375,"The bigger problem for me is why The Clash kept drifting away from their strength as one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Their 1977 debut was an incendiary mix of thrashing guitars and burning vocals. Give Them Enough Rope in 1978 and The Cost of Living E.P. both continued with a big guitar sound. London Calling (1979) is an unqualified success, but their further branching out beyond two guitar rock was evident in Rudie Can't Fall and Revolution Rock among other tracks from that release. The brief diversions into new territory that were enjoyed on London Calling, started to be called into question by the faithful on Sandinista. Here was a sprawling 3 LP meal that had large helpings of funk, rap, soul, dub reggae and beyond that really should have been condensed into just a single record, and that’s not even addressing the bigger issue of its overall thin quality. Combat Rock picked up where Sandinista left off with a loose funk hybrid that was sometimes interesting, but ultimately frustrating again in its small doses of what they did best - rock n' roll."

Sudden anger sparked out of nowhere to bloom with sharp intake of breath into full blown cold shaking rage. “What the fuck?!” he seethed through clenched and grinding teeth under narrowed glare. Small end table beside his window shook with the slam of mug quite more than just set upon its surface. Furious enough to disregard the bulk of reasons that kept him inside just to watch, he strode quick and purposeful toward and out his apartment’s door with quick grab and slap of filter mask to his face. Feet moved even quicker down the hall toward courtyard doors. All the anger fumed and grew with every step, the tirade he already imagined clear and sharp in his mind as he burst through them to step outside. He ignored the tears of his daughter to favor at least verbal attack of their cause, even though instinct already urged clenched fists and the need to use them."

We have to take this into account when we plan, especially with customers who want non-stop travel.” The more specific you are about your trip, the fewer cost-saving options will be available to you. However, if you can also be flexible on things like jet type, aircraft year of manufacture, date and time of travel, and airport, we can find the best price and options available. For example, flying into a general aviation airport like Paris’s Le Bourget could be much less expensive than flying into Charles DeGaulle."

If that sounds like a ludicrous statement, please get up from your computer, find a 13-year-old, and ask them to explain the difference between “fucker,” “motherfucker,” and “mofo” to you. (Here I must tell you that the manifold glories of the F-bomb have been covered by Jesse Sheidlower in his book, The F-word, which any scholar of dirty language or ironic hipster will want to own. Now you, too, can impress a lexicographer or a 13-year-old!) Lexicographers have different usage labels for the naughty words–my company uses vulgar and obscene–but sussing out which label to give a particular sense comes only with practice. My own, admittedly imperfect, litmus test for picking a word’s label: if I were to use this word in a sentence around my dad’s ironworker buddies and they respond with “fuck yeah!”, it’s vulgar. If I were to use this word in a sentence around my dad’s ironworker buddies and they respond by hollering, “Hey, watch your fucking mouth!”, it’s obscene. To add to the confusion, there are always–ALWAYS–citations that use naughty words in ways that are neither vulgar nor obscene. I swear, about 40% of the words in Trainspotting are variations on “fuck,” but only a handful of them are lexically vulgar or obscene: most of them are just used, as we say in the biz, “for intensity.” By page 6, you don’t even notice them anymore."

To fully appreciate the importance of small magazines and publishing, one has to look beyond the established magazines to the diversity that exists across the whole range of literary and cultural publishing. So while I will be following the creative and critical writing appearing in the major jour­nals, I will also be searching out the innova­tive, outrageous or merely interesting among the smaller, and often more vibrant, magazines. At the same time I intend to highlight the politics of small press publish­ing and to look back at some of the more influential literary magazines of the past twenty years in an attempt to understand the context in which contemporary maga­zines are operating today."
8467,"This grill was amazing! It was hot as anything, but after a while I got the hang of working with it, and was able to get chicken that was perfectly cooked, and tasty. The chicken ended up so tender that you could literally pull the leg bone out of the leg with a simple twist of a pair of tongs! Here’s how we worked this magic: two step cooking. Often you want the skin browned, and the temperature in an oven just won’t do it as easily as the high heat of a grill or a saute pan. In this case the grill actually had two levels. The lower level would be fine for cooking thinner foods like a burger, but the upper level was a bit cooler. So, we used the lower level to mark the chicken, and then finished it on the to level. Season the chicken, and then put it on the grill skin side down. After a couple of minutes, check it, and if it is browned flip it to the other side. Then after a few more minutes we just moved everything to the top level. I was actually able to get about 14 pounds on the lower grill at one time, and in two layers I got an entire 40 pound case of chicken on the top. This is how I got 200 pounds of chicken cooked in an afternoon. It took about 160 pounds of charcoal, and cost me a bit of arm hair, but everyone had a great time!"

Apparently since the meet is not conducted by the USATF (the governing body of USA Track and Field) it does not meet the criteria for IHSA to grant waivers. Illinois athletes will still be able to compete in Nike Outdoor Nationals as it is conducted after the IHSA Track season is over. Still, this is a huge blow to the national caliber athletes here in Illinois. Remember, it was Nike Indoor last year that served as the coming out party for Lukas Verzbicas. Now, this may not affect Lukas , as he has stated he will bypass the regular track season to get back to his triathlon season, but others such as Manfrin, Farleigh, etc. will have to choose between running here or competing for a state title later.

It focuses on four different women on the trail. One who converted to Mormonism and is excited about the promised land. Another who has married a missionary and is excited for her new life. Yet another, who along with her husband, is looking for a new adventure to confirm their new faith. And finally, a woman who does not believe but wants to save her marriage to her believer husband. Their stories overlap and turn into friendships of great strength. This is a well written book that is compels the reader to find a happy ending."

Half was finished, a quarter was more or less finished but still under scaffolding, and the remaining quarter - the church - had yet to be begun. Three states visible together. One end crisp white render contrasting with the pale clean exposed concrete. The middle under wraps, new double glazing panes lined up in the corridor. The other end looking slightly grubby, the render and the concrete hard to distinguish from one another."

Really? I have a total payroll of about 60 people, most of them working for the two radio stations I own in Bangor, Maine. If I hit the movie jackpot—as I have, from time to time—and own a piece of a film that grosses $200 million, what am I going to do with it? Buy another radio station? I don’t think so, since I’m losing my shirt on the ones I own already. But suppose I did, and hired on an additional dozen folks. Good for them. Whoopee-ding for the rest of the economy."

And time to invite a new neighbor over for coffee. Hopefully, it will mean that my energy won't get diverted by a frantic, self-imposed agenda. Only by God's agenda...the essence of true simplicity."

Unlike the iPad 2, the new iPhone packs 1GB of RAM, according to a source familiar with the SOC’s manufacturing.

I'm praying that in time my income from that will become steady enough to let me reduce my work hours. This opportunity has definitely been an answer to prayers for us.

It is said by psychiatrists and psychologists, sociologists and others charged with understanding the human mind, intention and causality, that our early life is important and the things that happen to us then often stay with us for the rest of our lives. If they are negative events then they can affect us negatively as we seek to find some resolution or way to reconcile them in our minds and experiences."
8510,"I started with linen cardstock, it's from a Bazzil and it came from open stock and I don't know the color, should pay more attention before I cut them up......and then added the ""Lavender Rosebuds"" paper by Paper Pizzaz. Next is some white cardstock that I distressed with Ranger's Bundled Sage Ink and some lavender colored scrap paper, name and brand unknown, that I used a Recollection's border punch on both sides. I then took a strip of white cardstock and worked in the background colors with a sponge (Ranger's Distress Inks...Tumbled glass, Wild Honey, and more Bundled Sage) and then used some assorted grass stamps, again with the Distress Inks to get that faded look in Wild Honey, Tea Dye, and Bundled Sage. Time for the focus stamp, Solidago Sprig by Rubber Stampede. I used some Liquid Applique and made tiny dots over the dots on the flower to give it the 3D effect and colored them with Copid markers in different shades of Violet. Then matted it on a rich brown cardstock, adhered it with Dimensional tape, added some ribbon, a bow and some pearls from Studio G. Viola, a nice note card...Ooops forgot about the butterfly.....have to have a butterfly in there. I took a Medium Butterfly punch from Fiskars and used it on some scrap black cardstock, folded it in half, took a smaller Butterfly stamp from Inkadinkado, colored in the wings and cut them apart and glued them to the black, positioned it on the card and added a little antennae with a black Fine Sharpie. Sorry for boring you, but from other Blogs I think you have to get the credits in there! Will try to simplify it in the future."

Their waiter had told them all the stories about its history- about Sinatra dancing on the tables with Ava Gardner, and about high jinks in the underground caverns during the war. Then the waiter had whisked them all off for a tour- and shown them the old underground well that gave the restaurant its name. He’d suggested they might like to throw a coin in for luck (and a tip, presumably) and the Vogue team had spotted an opportunity. They’d starting flinging about wads of notes and oodles of cash, and then asked the waiter (who looked just about ready to faint with joy) if they could have a receipt for their accountant…"

I still consider Marx the most challenging author I’ve read since arriving at Chicago; the guy’s brilliant, yes, but good lord could he have used a better editor. Yet reflecting back on that little discussion at the tail end of dinner, it seems obvious to me that a mastery of Marx is not beyond anybody; all that’s needed is a little combining of sosc class with gym class."

Namely that it has to find some account for why Melkur is able to defy the rules of the system. Doubly so within the Bidmead aesthetic, where the narrative rules of the system are paramount because they extend from the scientific rules. When Melkur breaks the rules of the Shakespearean world it is, in fact, a massive jaw-dropper of a moment. It’s just that the trick only works when you encounter the story in the wild. If you know that Melkur turns out to be the Master then the revelation is flat. If you don’t then it cuts against everything you think you know about the story simply because the story has, by all appearances, not been hiding anything prior to this point."

The Times reported the Liverpool battle as about 50 persons ”mostly coloured appeared in court after. ..”a gang of negroes' stoned several white men who were walking peacefully. They were armed with bottles, swords, daggers, iron bars, coshes and axes. The white men hopelessly outnumbered ran away.

8585,"A woman today can get pregnant every ten months—nine months of pregnancy and one month of recovery. (This is how my own mother did it with three of her children, in back-to-back fashion!) Women today typically give birth to one child per pregnancy. Sometimes twins are produced, but this is rare. If the human reproductive system is based upon the heavenly birthing process, though, it means that women are, by design and under the right conditions, to give birth to twins, a male and a female. This is because the planets are born by electrical expulsion, in which two planets come out at a time, one out of the north pole, one out of the south pole, one a “female” planet and the other “male.” Or, it may be that women are designed to give birth to first a male (or a female) and then at a later pregnancy a female (or a male.) But however is the design, we do know that females are capable of giving birth to twins, so the capacity is there."

Many people found themselves suffering for supporting what they considered to be the truth of the gospel. Not all were famous or important people even in their time, and certainly many are not remembered by name now. Some were simple ordinary people like the carpenter who made places for Catholic priests to hide in, some were priests or bishops, some were great scholars. They were not all of the same denomination either. Roman Catholics killed Protestants, Protestants killed Roman Catholics and even some Protestants killed Protestants. They each fell foul of those in authority in their day and suffered as a result, being executed as heretics and traitors."

Plenty of pundits challenged the economics of the bill: Bruce Bartlett noted that any “small” business (a category defined by having fewer than 500 employees), including Paris Hilton and the Los Angeles Dodgers, would be entitled to the 20% break, even if it never created a single job. But the convenient disappearance of once-mandatory offsets never made it into a news article. In recent days, Senator Jess Sessions of Alabama blocked a measure to bail out the U.S. Postal Service because “the bill would increase the federal deficit by $34 billion. In other words, the spending and debt under the postal bill violates the debt limit agreement reached just last summer.” The Budget Control Act prevents the Senate from considering legislation that will increase the deficit, which proves just how cynical Cantor’s small-business tax break really is.

Marketing experts have got us 30-somethings pegged with nostalgic toys. Cabbage Patch Kids, Smurfs, Care Bears, Transformers, and now bikes with big, high handlebars and baskets attached to the front. Very likely we are drawn to them because it makes us feel younger, comforted, happy. Or perhaps we're financially independent now, and can buy these things for ourselves, instead of begging our parents for months on end and wishing on stars."

Bram’s gotten so good at rolling over and grabbing his toys. He’s started to vocalize a lot more now, and we really feel like he’s grasping the baby signs that we’re teaching him. It seems like we’re on the verge of some big “firsts.” The three of us enjoy stories, toys, kisses, and songs together. When we can tell that he’s getting sleepy, we head outside. Bram has gotten comfortable taking his long afternoon nap in the stroller, so R pushes him all around while I go for my run. We’re out and about for well over an hour. The weather is beyond perfect. We see so many of our neighborhood friends playing with their families, as well. Life is good."

The only part the state had was in the opening of it before people ever settled in the territory through which it passed. Gen. Coffee, at the expense of the State, employed a crew of men, some thirty or forty, free-labor, and with the help of state surveyors, projected the road through a wild and uninhabited territory. It was just wide enough for two vehicles to pass and was not ditched or graded as is done at present (roads never had ditches until after the Civil War and very few then for many years). “"

8642,"We left Adelaide fairly early and drove to the Barossa along Gorge Rd, which was very spectacular, through the Torrens Valley, Birdwood and Springton to Eden Valley, which is near where the cottage is. It is on 10 acres and they have done heaps of work planting trees on the upper part of the property and vines and a garden closer to the house. The cottage is old – 1860s I think – with the very thick stone walls. We had a lovely egg and bacon pie for lunch at the old kitchen table, had a look around the property and then went to Yalumba for some tasting on the way into Anguston. Yalumba was grand and manicured. The wine did not match the surrounds in quality but fortunately not in price either. Anguston was a pleasant little town with nice old buildings, an excellent playground and what looked like a good bookshop. We went to the Angus Park dried fruit shop, which had lots of yummy, sugary things and a good cheap cookbook, which in May I’ve still yet to try but definitely plan to do so."

So I know this style of beer and saw it at one of our new DABC stores, (The one in Holliday just off Highland Drive AWESOME BEER SELECTION!) so I grabbed it and the Galloway Porter that they offer as well (haven't tried this one yet, I am waiting for my disappointment to wear off.) and opened the Stout last night. The first thing I noticed was an alcohol smell off the head which surprised me since it is less than 6% ABV. Then after tasting it I realized that the flavors just didn't last and that the mouth feel of it was very thin almost watery. The flavors were not bad, and there were some very nice chocolate, and coffee noted in it but they just did not last. Those issues alone would not make me completely write this beer off but then came the kicker. The aftertaste....The alcohol notes carried over into the finish of the beer and killed the good flavors it has at the start. The other issue is that the competition in this style is stiff -Captain Bastards Oatmeal Stout from Squatters- and -Madame X Stout from Hoppers- are both amazing and a few seasonals we have available are very nice as well."

8677,"It is important to point out that not all Japanese or Taiji residents are pro-hunting, and there are only a very small number of dolphin hunters who made their town infamous. A lot of Taiji residents are still unaware of the fact that the dolphin drive hunts occur every year. Louis Psihoyos, director of The Cove, and Ric O’Barry tried to raise awareness among the Japanese residents when the documentary was shown on the Tokyo International Film Festival in 2009. Many people were shocked that this was happening in their own country. Taro Ogichi said to the Tokyo Journal; “I’d seen the meat sold on the market, but had no idea Japan was a big dolphin-hunting nation. Whether or not Japan should stop is one thing, but we should at least be aware these hunts take place”. The Japanese media however, regarded the documentary as a film illegally taken to criticize the Japanese food culture. There is a strong taboo in the Japanese news media against any criticism of the country’s fishermen because they are often depicted as heroic defenders of a way of life. Locals claim that the documentary depicted them as barbarians."

8682,"On October 4, 2001, Siberia Airlines Flight 1812 crashed over the Black Sea. The plane was en route from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Novosibirsk, Russia, and all 78 people aboard were killed. The crash was initially thought to be a terrorist attack, since an Armenian plane near the scene reported seeing the Russian plane explode before it crashed into the sea. However, American intelligence reported that the crash was due to an errant S-200 surface to air missile fired as part of a Ukrainian Air Defense Forces exercise. Many people have labeled this hypothesis unlikely, considering the missiles range and safety features, claiming that the US was in fear of mass hysteria with yet another terrorist attack in the weeks following September 11. Ultimately, the government of Ukraine officially recognized their military’s fault in the accident and started negotiating compensation payments for victims’ relatives."

He put cold damp paper towels on my forehead and wiped my face during each contraction, which felt wonderful and helped distract me from the intense pressure. Most of all, I responded enormously to his positive encouragement. He’d say things like, “You’re doing a great job; you're so amazing; I'm so proud of you; our sweet baby boy is coming into the world because of you.” (Those words still make me tear up!) Every time he’d say something buoying, I’d feel a huge new wave of energy. I was amazed at how well positive encouragement helped, and I was so grateful to him."
8699,"As the FMSI Teller Line Study points out, consumer trends are certainly impacting how we are all interacting with our branches.

The data from the FMSI Teller Line study points out (a free download at fmsi.com/tellerlinestudy) that this change is and will be very gradual. However, if a financial institution does nothing to address this change, such as changing how they schedule their branches, they will undoubtedly eventually be seriously affected by this shift."

The money is being used for hiring more police men, buying more guns, and pepper spray, for new police cars with dark windows, so we can’t see who is driving them. The money is being used to fund the ever growing militia."

We also have been brainwashed (don't ask by who because I honestly have no idea where we all got this from) that we as individuals cannot make a difference and that it takes a gazillion of us to get anything done. In some ways this is, of course, true. If you have a mob of thousands, you're going to be heard faster than one person screaming at the top of his or her lungs. However, I believe that a well thought out plan enacted by an individual person can be more effective at making change happen than a mob that is easily written off as a group of apathetic, lazy moochers...

And I played with Matthew a lot, and he actually talked to me, can you believe it?! (Matthew is Olette's very, very shy 3rd-or-4th cousin, who happens to be in her class.) And we had breakfast in the cafeteria, and it was pancakes, and it came with a little container of syrup and I dipped my pancakes in there. And then I forgot my lunchbox in my backpack, so I had to eat cafeteria lunch, but it was pizza and salad and it was good, except I didn't eat the salad. I don't like salad. But there was pears for dessert and they were yummmmmy! And at nap time, I laid my towel on my cot. You know another girl brought her blanket? But the rest of us had towels. And I fell asleep, and it was snack time when I woke up. And we had PE in the gym and it was fun, but it was funner when we played on the playground. There's a slide and a tunnel!

Donate to organizations which help veterans? Heaven knows there's going to be a fresh crop with brain injuries and such."

We should all make sure to cherish precious moments. If you don't they'll slip away and might not become part of the wonderful memories engraved in your heart."
8744,"Once we have the two price points in mind, we obviously launch with the introductory price. We promote it as an introductory price and don't necessarily communicate an end date as that gives us flexibility to change the end date at need. Per our launch strategy, we set the book free for 2 days. Trending shows that books following the ""normal"" post-free cycle seem to hit their peak rank and sales on Day 3 or Day 4 then begin a slow decay. Our intent is to capitalize and maximize. We want to shore up royalties in the face of the decline, keeping the monetary base from eroding as quickly as sales. In theory, this should mean more money earned overall for the books by the time they plateau in the week or so after the price change."

I turned the pieces upside down, shuffled them and then set them aside for a moment. Then, I told my students a few true stories. I told them stories of how I had come to find respect and trust in our learning space. I thanked my principal and asked her to step out. Then, slowly, with honesty and love, I drew one piece of paper at a time. Slow, as I read each name in turn, I thanked each student for the gifts they have offered me over the last 9 weeks. We cried. And we spent the rest of the day laughing, awash in tears, gratitude and reflection."

8749,"Sad to say, most of the writers I met as a teenager had shoulder chips and cruel streaks and lousy interpersonal skills, so I thought learning through humiliation was the norm for the field. In six years of university, I only took one class that involved writing in a group setting – and I can still picture the prof cutting down a student (the sweetest one, of course), calling him a one-dimensional man. In my limited experience, writing teachers did not attack bad writing. They attacked other writers. (And they weren’t very interesting, either - while the biologists at school were all talking about how fascinating the world was, the writers were all talking about themselves. Yawn.) I didn’t want to sit through their classes."

It is thought that it took an MIT student to figure out that he had all those extra fingers on his right hand because [REDACTED] and the lack of livestock near campus.

And all the people who feel despair and cannot imagine such a change have not read any history, or haven't paid attention while reading it.

The Shield was excellent in beginning but misses out due to losing the plot a bit in it’s final two seasons. It did have an ending, but didn’t quite do it for me. Walton Goggins went from this to Justified (he was / is excellent in both) Game of Thrones I absolutely love, but it is simply too new. If the second season is as good or better than the first, this might be replacing something above. Rome was good but after being cancelled for the end of the second season, had to rush a bit to finish things off. Boardwalk Empire, was a close call, excellent in places but a little lacking in tension for me. Plus they killed off my favourite character at the end of last season so that might take away something for me. Terminator: The Sarah Connor chronicles was much more fun than I thought it would be, and might have been a contender had it not gotten cancelled without an ending. Lost was top fun but had a crappy ending that didn’t explain enough for me and just didn’t do it justice for me either. That was a shame as the shortened final seasons had mostly been a joy."

8800,"So for all those looking for “reasons” why Bolt lost perhaps you’re looking at the wrong person and the wrong reasons. It may not be all about Bolt and whether or not he wanted or didn’t want to win – sounds rather ridiculous to even say. Yes he was injured earlier, but has since run 9.86 and 9.82 and defeated Asafa Powell who has also run 9.82 this season. And Tyson Gay has had injury ills of his own this season (and last). But then, to get a race full of athletes that are all 100% on any given day is somewhat of a fallacy. Charlie Greene took to the starting line of the 100 in Mexico City with a hamstring issue. Ditto Tommie Smith in the 200. Jim Hines beat Charlie Greene, Tommie Smith won gold in a WR. Calvin Smith was injured at the Trials in ‘84, Carl Lewis went on to double gold. Mo Greene pulled up during the race in Edmonton yet held off Tim Montgomery for the win. Tyson Gay took to the starting line in Berlin having nursed a groin all season – lost to Bolt, defeated Powell. When you line up only track nerds like me remember what your condition was, history simply writes down the results – wins, losses and times."

They were actually here when we moved here and since they were already here, we can't get rid of them because they don't belong to us. But we are welcome to use them anywhere in the house. I figure that I can put these boards in there with those ones (they are similar in style, wood tone and everything)."

I think maybe the tide and the waves hypnotise you and pull you back to them time and time again. They certainly seem to be having that affect on me.

We heard a talk the other week where the speaker pointed out that often, maybe always, WE are God’s answer to the needs of others. This is not arrogance, this is God’s idea! He wants to empower us to do His work in meeting the needs of our neighbours, our towns & quite possibly people halfway round the world. But often, we still ask God to do things that we should be doing!"

Nice boys who were able to see past my shit and try to insert themselves into my life despite the Roger Waters-esque WALL I built around myself to keep them out. They kissed me, they gave me tokens of their affection, a few brave ones even told me they loved me…Poor boys. I wanted nothing to do with that. I wanted nothing to do with “needing” and “loving” and “forever”. Oh hell no. Life was too unpredictable and scary to let someone take me from me.

It also showed me that miracles, even if they are only very minor, personal ones, do indeed still happen in this mundane old world of ours. And that is something else well worth treasuring."

By giving them shotguns instead of pistols their profiles have changed enough to make them seem like original figures. They are well-sculpted and not too big. On the whole, they will work okay if you add them to cop figures from other companies. For example, Hasslefree's Ken, with his choice of pistol or shotgun, would make for a great companion to either or both of the two Foundry street cop sets."

We can choose to plant the seeds of wholeness, wellness, joy, love, beauty, success, dreams, simplicity, harmony, balance, fun, creativity, relationships, communication, forgiveness, reconciliation, hope, faith, strength, courage, wisdom, completion, discipline, longevity, health, adventure, positivity and so much more… There are an infinite amount of seeds available to plant in the fertile soil of our consciousness. The trick is to continue nurturing them and not dig them up. When we plant a seed, we are expressing faith in Universal Laws or Truths that we can trust to manifest our desires. Tomato seeds produce tomatoes. They can’t produce cucumbers because that’s not the intention of their seeds. The same in true for planting seeds of joy, wisdom, love and anything else in life; they all correspond to the intention of that particular seed. Therefor, paying attention to the seeds we plant in our own minds, correspond with the outcomes we experience in our own lives."

My job is to take a class of school children to a particular station such as: the grist mill, the barn, the general store, the laundry area, the broom shed, the old school, the post office, the log cabins, the saw mill, the blacksmith and other stations. My children are supposed to help in this small task. I think Reece assisted me once and didn't even know it. I think he has a fear of crowds because Friday when there were over 800 students he stayed near me almost the entire day. The day before there were over 600 students and I rarely saw him. My daughter and a friend took a few classes to stations and called it a day before running off to play. Basically, their main job is to play! They have preformed their duty very well I might add. The school children absolutely get a kick out of watching my kids and the other fortunate children (homeschooled children) run around in the homestead in their appropriate attire. Some children have asked my kids if they lived there and really had to wash their laundry in the wash tubs."

And what captivated me was not internet shopping or YouTube, but the corner of the net devoted to YA writing. It was like a whole other world for me, a world where YA writers weren't working all alone in their tiny boxroom in their damp, building-site houses, with a permanent cough (I was later diagnosed as asthmatic) and going days without speaking to anyone but their dog or people who had phoned them at their crappy office job to shout at and verbally abuse them. A world where YA writers were slap in the middle of a community that seemed full of kindred spirits and dear friends. I watched their vlogs, I read their reviews on Goodreads, I laughed at their funny blogs. I told myself that I found their success inspiring and that they helped me to keep positive and keep working."

Our evening continued at Reflex, a nightclub with a fixation with the 1980s. Dyke had arranged for us to jump the substantial queue, by putting our names of the guest list. Dyke plied us with more free alcohol, visiting the bar intermittently to return with armfuls of drink. This began to have an effect on Sam Hewitt. I knew he was in trouble when I saw him trying to dispense soap from the toilet attendant's crotch. He was still, somehow able to maintain a certain level of poise as he left the cubicle, that has come to be expected from his performances at right-back. Yes, he had a vacant expression on his face, but that was perfectly normal. However, to the sharper eye there was a tell-tale give away to his state, the main one being his shoes, which I could have sworn were were showered in flecks of vomit. I suspected most of it to be his."

I see love like a tree and from that tree the fruit produced are love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. All these fruits do so much more than help me live a good life but also give life and make life. I can recall many a times someone has brought my joy, kindness, and faithfulness. They affected my life in some way and to me that is more than just fruit. When I think of those acts I have to also think of the opposite and it stirs my heart to pray to God to cleanse me from all unrighteousness so I don’t cause any bad fruit to grow in my heart because bad fruit means a bad tree. I don’t want to impact anyone in a way that would cause them not to have peace, joy, faithfulness and joy just naming a few."

It’s main attraction were the pipes that had been tipped there, big concrete affairs, wide enough to walk through and shelter in when it was pouring down, that tumbled down a steep slope and ended somewhere underwater. Who knows, perhaps there were more underwater than above it. Some kids would drag a pallet and a couple of oil drums from the local industrial estate and construct a raft but I was far too afraid of water at that age to suggest or agree to anything so reckless; I didn’t learn to swim until I was a teenager and I wouldn’t call myself a good swimmer now but I could probably save my own life."

A life centered around God is fulfilling; it will make the “days of trouble” – when disabilities, sickness, and handicaps cause barriers to enjoying life – satisfying because of the hope of eternal life. Being young is exciting, but the excitement of youth can become a barrier to closeness with God if it makes young people focus on passing pleasures instead of eternal values. Make your strength available to God when it is still yours – during your youthful years. Don’t waste it on evil or meaningless activities that become bad habits and make you callous. Seek God now.”"

It wasn’t surprising, since these types tend to burn bright and fast. But it was still a let down, especially when “old friend” turned into “new girlfriend” within a week or so.

Written by Roger McGuinn and Jacques Levy, it’s a retelling of Peer Gynt’s opening act—except in this version, a horse takes the place of the reindeer. The narrator, Gene Tryp (I presume) is, like Gynt, something of a bullshit artist. The difference here, though, is that Peer Gynt didn’t fall in love with the reindeer.

The adultery thesis is not considered likely, as the Queen was a very pious woman, and there is no knowledge of even the slightest mistake of hers. It would be very difficult in Versailles to have a liaison and even to give birth in secret. Every Royal birth happened in public, in the Queen's bedchambers, with all courtiers present as witnesses. The little princess Marie-Anne was born (16 November 1664) with a dark skin caused by cyanosis, and died shortly after birth (26 December 1664). Some say that the baby remained black, and had been changed with a dead girl, to avoid scandal. According to Madame, wife of Louis XIV's brother, her husband said that the child was not black at all but very ugly. In any case, although the story about the black daughter of Maria Theresa is unconfirmed, it was still persistent and believed by many."

I call them ‘soft’ because they do not impact our daily lives, even though we live in the shadow of nuclear destruction and environmental pollution (I am suspicious of ‘Climate Change’ being treated as a pseudo-religion, one which supplants the Gospel in the minds of too many Catholics and Christians; the only unforgiveable sin for them seems to be one’s ‘carbon footprint’).

9139,"Captain America: I mentioned in my review that it would be incredibly difficult for Steve to adjust to the time period, and they absolutely had that in here. His PTSD from the war and waking up with everyone he knows being dead, that’s revealed quickly and respectfully. His hesitance to take command even though he’s able to do it, his unwavering devotion at first to being a soldier who follows the rules, and he is a man out of time who never gets anyone’s references or understands modern technology. He is Team Dad in this movie, calming everyone down, but when he finally steps up as the leader in that last sequence, it feels so right. He might not be able to call thunder or shoot energy beams out of his hands, but he has the big picture in mind and he knows how to use soldiers. One tiny problem here, when they did a clip of all the things from the war he misses, why didn’t they include Bucky? They had the war and the plane and Peggy, but losing his best friend was a huge blow for him. I was surprised just one clip wasn’t in there. PLUS THAT MASK IS HORRIBLE TAKE IT OFF."

He cites reports of native peoples who used the word “I” when speaking of their group and others who see their land as an extension of their self, so that being forced away from their land would be tantamount to death (this is why native peoples are often prepared to commit suicide rather than leave their lands)."

What if we did a song in worship driven principally by a real simple beat? Often our songs in contemporary worship are based upon a guitar riff, or a simple melody, or a bombastic chorus – but I don’t see many songs moving with a simple groovy beat. Why not break out of the mold – because by doing a song built in a different way it will draw in the congregation during worship."

9152,"So, back to the story in hand. Usually a trip to the Court of Appeal would have been the end of the matter (at least as far as we, the judgment-consuming masses, are concerned). Floyd J had ordered an inquiry into damages suffered by Perini (or, at its option, an account of profits) in October 2009, based on his findings in the original dispute. One might therefore have expected the parties to slug it out between themselves and reach a settlement. However, as the reader may by now have twigged, this did not happen. Perini duly elected for damages, but there were nevertheless questions concerned with the calculation. Accordingly, almost three years after the original spat first worked its way through the courts, the parties are still at it, arguing over the damages."

9254,"7) In the popular idiom, a general strike is as old as the hills, or at least as old as the hills of Rome. According to H.G. Wells, the first general strike properly took place in Rome by the lowly plebeians. The plebeians “saw with indignation their friends, who had often served the state bravely in the legions, thrown into chains and reduced to slavery at the demand of patrician creditors.” For veterans of the Iraqi or Afghanistan wars this might sound eerily familiar. In the U.S., one of the first general strikes was the infamous Railroad Strike of 1877. This was, in infancy, the beginning of a nascent labor movement showing its muscle across the nation, culminating ultimately in the May 1, Haymarket strikes and riots that led to the weekend, child labor laws, and the 8 hour day.

It is like no other movie ever, a true original delivered by one of the most out of the box writers out there. Charlie Kaufman is on another level when it comes to writing – he is a genius. This movie is a great example of how imaginative and different he is; it is such a crazy movie. He is more known for his other films like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, but this has always been my favorite of his films, with Adaptation being an extremely close second. On the DVD cover Peter Travers of Rolling Stones magazine is quoted describing this movie as “A smart, sexy, and seriously funny comedy.” That leads me to wonder if he actually saw the film. I would hardly call it funny at all much less describe it as “a seriously funny comedy.” This movie is about love and loss, pain and heartache, and the emotional roller coaster relationships tend to be. I find myself having difficulty trying to categorize it because it is so different than everything else. I considered leaving it as a lone “uncategorized” film before settling on just creating a new category for “love story,” but never once considered placing it in comedy."

That being said however, vacation is a wonderful thing. I love my days off.

The smart thing for us to be contemplating is to sell this block and buy a bigger block, such as an eightplex and building equity and appreciation there. We talked ourselves out of that too though because it's a lot of work and it's better to appreciate what you have than go jumping into the unknown. There's some big expenses coming up here in the next few years, some masonry work, the roof and a little basement leakage problem that isn't bad yet, but surely will worsen.

9336,"Beyond all this discussing, I kept reflecting on our current position as writers. He agreed with me when I said that there really isn’t a place of us, the more dedicated “traditional” writer. Most writers, it seemed to us, were college educated professors, at least from the one’s we know and have experienced, who are more interested in forming groups and bullshitting with one another. Us “students” can only reach that level if we buddy-buddy with them enough, write like they do, and are into the same things they are. I find this irresponsible and the main thing killing the so-called literary scene of today. Writing has gone back to academics, but into the hands of the newer irresponsible academics, who are more interested in making a name for themselves, or making friends with someone. It feels like the high school mentality all over again, but within adults who should know better – adults who shouldn’t be looked upon as mentors."

Nearly all scientists who study the biology of aging agree that we will someday be able to substantially slow down the aging process, extending our productive, youthful lives."

Almost like I’m not sure what I’m getting into, but I have a feeling it’s going to be an interesting adventure. Over the past few years, my life is just totally different & I haven’t really processed this change in myself till lately. How I spend my time, my priorities – everything has changed and sometimes I have these moments, like yesterday when I realize I have ALREADY changed during this process and it makes me so proud of myself."

Now, should what he needed was indeed very important, I honestly wouldn't mind the way he treated Tori. But to seduce a woman, just for something like that, is unethical. Surely it's unethical on both accounts, but at least if it's a matter of life and death you can forgive someone the lengths he goes to succeed. But Brit, has no excuses. And I simply couldn't really like him after that. He kind of reminded me a spoiled kid who does anything to achieve whatever he wants."

Then I tried the balcony (which only works in good weather by the way) to get me “out of the house” without being out of the house and found that it was much too cold even on balmy days due to the wind (unless I am in a bad mood and going for the me against the world attitude)."

Free-Range is not about negligence or sloth (well, maybe a teeny bit of sloth, but is that so terrible?). It’s about trying to assess reality and figure out whether the world has really become so much more dangerous in just one generation (since those carefree days of the Cold War) that children cannot be afforded the same kind of freedom we had."
9481,"7:25- Heath and the kids are out the door. He takes them to daycare because it is on his way to work. Our daycare is about half way between my office and his which makes it really convenient if he needs to go in early and I need to take drop off duty for the day. We've been with our daycare provider since Brody was born. We left for a short while but were back because we realized she was the best! I think having Heath drop the kids off and leaving me at home every morning really helps my attitude towards working. If I was leaving them every morning (especially when he was a newborn) I think that I would have a harder time working. It's all mental, but it works for me."

9483,"First: Danielle de Niese as Adina. I have listened to and not enjoyed her three recital discs - some of the singing is really very poor. But tonight it was almost like a different voice and I've never heard her sing so well. She started out rather tweety sounding, the vibrato very narrow and fast (nerves?), but she got better and better as the night went on, the sound relaxing and opening out, and by the second half she was on fire. In fact, as the music got harder she got better, and in the virtuosic final scene where she declares her love for Nemorino, she was easily better than anyone in the Rinaldo production I had seen the night before. I think she has improved a lot in the last year - I was seriously impressed and surprised. She's also a fantastic stage animal, moving so naturally, acting beautifully, vocally as well as physically, and of course she's absolutely gorgeous (even more so on stage than in real life I think). She really is close to being the ideal Adina, with the requisite sexual confidence, coquettishness and vulnerability to make the role really convincing and even interesting, and as she proved here, she's exactly right vocally too. I'm a total convert after being extremely skeptical. What a talent."

Wild dolphins travel up to 50 miles a day, and they form complex social groups in the wild – they socialize. A pool is like a cage to the dolphins. They can not behave naturally in captivity, and the facilities are not able to provide for their behavioral needs. This causes them terrible stress which severely compromises their health and immune system functions and can eventually result in death. Captive dolphins may also suffer and die from intestinal disease and chlorine poisoning."

9505,"Here is what I have learned: people do not change. The most “enlightened” sounding people can be the most disturbed and do not know themselves at all; they need professional help. As much as we are all in this together with our friends, family, neighbors, ultimately, we are alone. We are born alone and we will die alone. The most important thing to have is strength in yourself. We all need that wisdom and courage it takes to go to bed and wake up the next day knowing that even though it is hard to put one foot in front of the other, we have no choice but to continue. That even in uncharted territory we must force ourselves to go on and that family is not necessarily defined by blood lines but by goodwill, caring, kind, well-intentioned, love. Pure and simple. Love should not be that complicated, and if it always is, there is something very, very wrong."

When you do the opposite of things it attracts attention, and if you can spin it off in a positive attraction such as acquiring customers then it’s not so bad."

Back in india, before my marriage Sundays used to be my culinary experimental days: white rats? My parents and two dogs :). Once I came across this awesome honey bread recipe, I decided I am gonna make it. My mother being wiser told me to use half the quantity since it’s an experiment. Well no , I was very sure that this will be a success and I some how convinced her. The ingredients were 1kg all purpose flour, honey and blah blah blah. I made it according to the instructions and a golden brown loaf was the result. I made tea and invited my parents to the table. Hmmm you should have the seen the look on my father’s face, as if his daughter has conquered the world. They both sat down and I started slicing the bread, well the knife was not moving. How do you cut a chicken? Yeah I had to use the same butcher knife and the force.

Introverts need to learn that it is okay to say that they are in the middle of something and would rather not socialize. Introverts work out their ideas by thinking inside their heads and they often need to remind extroverts that they are not ignoring them, rather they are silently processing what they just heard. Extroverts are talkers. This is hard and draining for introverts. Introverts need to remember to get alone time after being with a talkative extrovert to recharge and not blame extroverts for their need to talk or take it personally. Both types need to remember that the other type is drained by what energizes them. The world is filled with introverts and extroverts and we need to be more understanding and accepting of"

Nelson Mandela told us what he wanted his followers to do with the Whites when he sang his MK pledge song about killing Whites. Mzukizi Gaba (ANC) was open and honest when he said “When Mandela dies we will kill you Whites like files”. The Black student protesters and Peter Mokaba were sincere when they chant(ed) “Kill the boer, kill the farmer” and “One Settler, one bullet”, and Jacob Zuma warned us when he sang “bring me my machine gun”.

9560,"The lack of coherent narrative also raises questions as to why the author placed Tsar Alexander I at the center of his study. First, Schenk fails to make a convincing connection between Alexander and the radical religious ideas that emerged after the revolution and influenced the creation of the Holy Alliance. If Alexander was under the sway of this radical democratic Christianity, why did he allow Metternich to change the document and then sign it? Moreover, if for the author the Holy Alliance is crucial to the congress system, why is it also only examined in the first section? How does membership in the Holy Alliance affect the members’ political decisions concerning social unrest in Europe? This again relates to the lack of a coherent narrative by the author. Schenk spends a great deal of time explaining the religious ideas of the period and the creation of the Holy Alliance but fails to address these again until the epilogue in which they receive only brief attention. Overall, Schenk’s book appears to be a collection of essays that examine Europe during the congress system but ultimately fail to produce a coherent understanding of the period."

This fact alone seems to spur a lot of parents to definitely go forward with vaccines. It made me even more gun-shy of getting him immunized. In my mind, I couldn’t help but remember that my pediatrician has always wanted to delay vaccines if one of my children were sick when they were due for vaccines, exactly because it wasn’t a good idea to put toxins into the bodies of children whose immune systems were compromised by illness. Seven months after Finn was born, my husband was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer, and throughout his treatment, our kids could not receive live-virus vaccines because Michael’s indirect exposure could prove very dangerous to him while his immune system was compromised by chemo. That said a lot to me, too. Vaccines are not entirely benign; they can be dangerous."

Since it was my last day to take care of the dog, I decided to spend an extra hour playing with him, having him fetch that tennis ball and letting him run up and down the park. And when we got home, I gave him two full scoops of food instead of the scoop and a half. He's earned it. And while I'm a little sad to see him go home, it's going to be nice to be able to sleep in a little longer and eat my meals without feeling guilty about the dog looking at me with his sad, pleading eyes."

9570,"‘Un pull.’ Chaos ensued. Probably only one of them remembered that ‘un pull’ was a sweater but as soon as he had started ripping it off, the others got the drift and joined in. A young lad, who had until that moment been watching the proceedings with quiet disinterest, turned to his neighbour and started pulling off her jumper with a feverish excitement that was not perhaps in the spirit of the game."
9571,"Anyone interested in the nondual side of psychology has to investigate what’s going on at the University of Lethbridge. I also recommend the conference to anyone interested in nonduality, not just psychologists. You’re going to hear a lot more from Gary Nixon in various ways in coming years. I continue to work with Gary as senior associate editor for the Paradoxica Journal of Nondual Psychology and as a member of his Board of Reviewers. I’m really pleased to be involved with the group there."

Women in long colorful period dresses and stiff sunbonnets mingle with those wearing khaki shirts and wide bush hats, dark from years of accumulating sweat. Large pistols share belt space with cell phones. A group practices whip cracking. Crowds cheer as teams of large, grunting men compete at tug-of-war."

9575,"With Sohrab saved, Amir decides he wants to adopt him (he and his wife can’t have children), and promises Sohrab he will never send him back to an orphanage. However, Amir finds out that the easiest way to get Sohrab a visa might be to let him spend some time in an orphanage. He tells Sohrab this, and Sohrab reacts horribly. The last time he was in an orphanage he was sexually assaulted and he does not want to go back. That night, Sohrab attempts to commit suicide. Amir finds him in time and Sohrab is saved, but never the same."
9576,"After two failed relationships and six stints as a bridesmaid, Stephanie Ludlow is convinced she’s man-poison. So when her hormones point due south to her sexy new landlord, she throws up every guard in her arsenal to protect herself from heartbreak. Problem is, her cache is sadly lacking."
9577,"Last month’s star was Steven H. Davis, whose assurances during an interview for Fortune magazine produced an article titled “Dewey & LeBoeuf: Partner exodus is no big deal.” Right — Dewey started the year with 300 partners; 30 were gone by the time of Davis’s interview; 40 more have left since then. Among his least prescient remarks: “If the direction we’re taking the firm in was somehow disapproved of, then the reality is that there ought to be a change in management. But I don’t sense that.”"

9580,"He says he is concerned by “two climatic events in particular: the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which will raise global sea levels significantly, and the episode of extreme heat in western central Europe last August, accepted by many scientists as unprecedented and a direct result of global warming.” He is right to be concerned."
9581,"And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,"
9582,"Back during the WW2 era and the Baby Boomer generation, the big thing was graduating high school. So many kids dropped out to get jobs and help support the family, and obviously entered the work force immediately. College was something that mainly the wealthy did because they could afford it. Obviously, with the wars, and the high percentage of people who served in the military, the GI Bill enabled many vets to go and get a higher education. This translated into the generation before me and my generation. Parents often said "" NO! YOU ARE GOING TO COLLEGE!"" And now the late part of my generation (and the generation after) is doing college-level work in HS, and basically post-grad stuff in college."

I figured the engine was still lit, there is just something... about new things, large amounts of decision making and sorting, that just shuts down my machine. I can drill through rock, metal, whatever, but when I hit muck that's it. I get lost in the shadows of the past, the potential of the future, the vast vagueness of the universe itself if I don't have something solid to work with."
9586,"Ok now I need to go and clear the holy mess on my desk and floor, before I kill myself leaping over everything and unbury my armchair...so that I can stream on USTREAM tonight."
9587,"I stood up and went over to the family room where most of my family was, sitting around the main table made of oak, in chairs so deep it looked as if they would sink forever into them. Most of the kids sat next to the piano, playing with toys or fiddling with things that interested them that made the adults ask every so often, “Joe, what the hell is wrong with your kid? He’s fingering the carpet or something.” He’d follow that up with a laugh, and the family would chuckle while Joe runs over and tells his kid to knock that shit off and play with everyone else."

9593,"I worked extremely hard in mastering these tracks up to as much snuff as I could humanly do with the tools in my arsenal. Where there was a previous reference point available for EQ, I matched up B to A as best I could (in that ""The Queen Is Dead"" now sounds identical - in EQ, that is - to the official less-lengthy version, for example). Where there wasn't, I used similar sounding tracks from (ideally) the same recording session. And when I couldn't do that, I trusted my ears. But every track needed a fair touch of massaging, not Steve's fault but rather due to the nature of the source itself."

Blessed Mother Teresa advocated NFP at the National Prayer Breakfast in 1994, among other places, and she taught the poor and illiterate how to read the signs of fertility in their bodies. If anyone were to be immune from O’Brien’s criticism that the church needs to “meet people where they already are and find out what they need,” surely it was she."
9598,"That's a really valuable insight because it highlights where I need to spend my efforts and also suggests that it's not about something being ""wrong"" with me. The pool of single men I might really fit with is just really small because of who I am and what I'm looking for. I need to work on expanding that, rather than beating myself up."

9621,"Therefore, the question that makes distinction between “folklore and local practice” and “pagan sources” slightly confuses me. You see, there is no need to reconstruct a custom that already exists, and had existed for thousands of years without any change. And the term “local” practice applied on rituals that are performed in areas sometimes divided by thousands of kilometers made me smile. Of course, numerous customs were banned or discontinued with the advance of Christianity–more so in urban than in rural areas. Good example for that is that now Slavic people bury their dead instead of burning them."

Doesn’t bother to pause it or anything that might make sense. So, I simply say “Is she screaming?” Quiet, then in a very breathy voice says yes. Nice! “Are you jerking off?” In shorter breaths says “I’m thinking about your ass!” Then cums. I naturally hang up, not because I don’t like a little phone sex.

Hardly anyone is familiar with it, so coverage of these events has tended to analogize it with a criminal trial. So, in translation, ""examiners"" become ""prosecutors,"" ""findings of fact"" become a ""ruling."" But this is an administrative procedure governed by its own rules (pdf). I'll admit, I've found myself struggling to wrap my own head around the intricacies and nuance of the process."

9651,"So now I skip that section of the menu and indulge in the pasta instead. Fred was smart from the get go, ordering the exact same pasta dish - the Tajarin - handcut tagliatelli, 5 hour pork sugo and porcini mushrooms, on every visit. He clearly knows something that I don't because at one point I imagined that, surely, the paparadelle with braised short rib ragu and roasted chanterelles must be even better. It wasn't, of course, and so I sent its meaty, extremely rich goodness (it was good, I just couldn't eat it with a Tajarin sitting in forking distance), back to the kitchen and took a plate of what Fred was having instead. I don't know what it is about that dish, but those buttery, thin, wiggly, tender, handcut noodles with the perfect amount of meat sauce on top deliver us both 100% satisfaction. There are two sizes, $10 and $15. The $15 is too much for me and the $10 is too little for Fred. Go figure. Go order!"

Since this ad went from photographed to finished in under an hour, it wasn’t as polished or well thought out as I wanted, but it worked as a concept.

The latest person to swallow its fable-version of history is a geologist called Donald Prothero, who is one of a number of bloggers at Skepticblog and who has written a glowing review of the film entitled ""Hypatia, Agora and Religion vs Science"". Prothero is Professor of Geology at Occidental College in Los Angeles and, judging from his posts, someone who has been keeping up the fight against the irrational idiots of the ""Creation Science"" movement and its latest stalking horse, the ""Intelligent Design"" political lobby. For that he deserves both our thanks and our pity. Unfortunately, probably as a consequence, he has bought the ""Conflict Thesis"" idea wholesale and so is happy to find it being reinforced by the version of history found in Agora. Of course, it's probably not entirely fair to expect a geologist to have much of a grasp of Late Roman history or to be up on the early history of science. But he seems to be taken as an authority on these matters by the readers of Skepticblog, judging from the readers' comments. Which is a worry, because, despite referring to ""scholarly sources"" that he consulted when writing his review, he makes a complete hash of the history behind this story."

9726,"Early in his career Springsteen seemed obsessed with cars, the road, and the need to escape. ‘Born to Run’, released in 1975, speaks of wholesale disenchantment – “In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream. At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines.” Turnpikes, highways, and freeways all feature strongly in Bruce’s USA. The automotive imagery is potent – “Just wrap your legs ‘round these velvet rims, and strap your arms across my engines”. The song pleads with the audience to get out while they’re young. Destination unknown, it is the freedom of leaving that matters."

9760,"Consider the unfortunate case of Kentucky’s Republican candidate for the Senate, Rand Paul. (Short for Randall, for those who were wondering.) In a recent interview, MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow repeatedly questioned Paul about his documented concerns with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The whole interview was painful, though your reasons for finding it so will likely depend upon your political leanings. For her part, Maddow proved genuinely incapable of imagining an approach to an issue that is neither a) premised solely on the liberty of the individual or b) dependent upon direct political action. Sadly, Maddow is not alone in this struggle. But Paul came off as uncertain and disingenuous. His attempts to frame the debate more broadly looked more like an attempt to dodge a tough question. And as Ross Douthat has noted, Paul doesn’t seem to understand the limits of ideology."

The listener can tell the difference between a plain-vanilla copy, and a copy with additional bells and whistles. Therefore, in my opinion, a sliding scale test may be adopted to adjudge the extent of copy: One end has the simple copy to copy, and the other end has the copy that sounds totally different than the original. Therefore a vast majority of the creations may fall in a gray zone-neither a complete copy nor a full creative variation on an original."

9768,"I guess the spice of this series comes from the fact that Oreki is a boring protagonist. He whines and hates to make an effort and for some reason, it rubs on me. From a perspective, this series is totally eye-candy with a content not worth giving a fuck. But the thing is, if I would compare this with Tasogare x Otome, i’d prefer to waste time on this series. Not only is this visually stimulating, the random school mysteries makes sense. I’m not saying that the mysteries ARE interesting. In fact, the mysteries aren’t even material worth giving fuck about. But Oreki’s deduction draws me in. This may not be a murder which involves reasoning to define the culprit but the act of driving to a conclusion is pretty much this show’s glimmer."

The emphasis of the talk will focus on a variety of theories of reincarnation and the political context within which those theories were developed. He will also address the topic of participatory knowing and the importance of paranormal perceptions as an adjunct to reincarnational theories in western esotericism. Five explicit examples of theories on reincarnation will be presented: Plato, Origen, the Cathars, Jan Baptist van Helmont, and H. Spencer Lewis. Each example will be contextualized by culture and the religious environment to demonstrate issues of contestation or marginalization. Overall, the author’s approach supports reincarnation as a viable theory for post-mortem existence."

I mean, who doesn't want to go to a big store with great coffee and a billion books? Problem is, evidently not enough people to keep all those stores open. Both big chains have struggled and now Borders is likely filing bankrupcy and closing 150 stores. (I'm praying for a last minute intervention, but it's not looking great.)"

9786,"I originally had thought to leave recruitment relatively open for about 4 weeks, but given the success we’ve had to date, I believe it would not be premature to go ahead and narrow the path to guild membership. This means we will be adopting a new recruitment policy that will effectively suspend open recruitment (i.e., stop actively advertising the guild on the server by directly contacting unguilded potential recruits, and posting guild advertisements to channels like Trade, etc.). Such promotional activities are necessary evils, but I think we have reached a threshold of activity that will allow us to suspend those activities, at least temporarily."

They are looking at him to be about a .320/.430/.750 or so, maybe a bit higher. This would come with a bit less than 20 HRs. Call me optimistic, but I think he can and will do better than this (come on fantasy pick, don’t fail me now). I think he will like Fenway a lot this year. Maybe he can hit 40 2Bs while playing for the Sox. If that is the case, we could see a definite upward trend in that SLG%. Add a few more HRs (also I think possible), and we may see something along the lines of a .325/.475/.800 line from Beltre. I think that that is very reasonable actually. He had a .784 OPS in Seattle two seasons ago, and Fenway is a MUCH better hitting field than Safeco. So, I think he will surprise people to say the least. We all KNOW his defense is going to be good. He could be another gold glover at the hot corner. Yeah, this infield defense is going to be something special to watch I think."

It's quite different from the muddled, rich, taste of a custard-based vanilla ice cream. My vanilla-ice-cream-loving husband really enjoyed the ice cream, which is a good thing, seeing as we have 2 quarts of it!"

We’d bought our house in ’97, here it was 2002 and the builder was still involved and only meeting to go over what had to be repaired after I’d filed a discrepancy report with the warranty program which was government run."

9880,"This is an idea I really like because it has the potential to make use of my favorite character kindred, humans, in a major way. The majority of the players will obviously need to be human (2/3 or 3/4). There could be hobbs or leprechauns as well, but a player choosing one of these kin would need to have a good explanation as to how they came into the service of the wizard. Elves and dwarves are out; these are just two of the alien beings that inhabit Trollworld. The characters will eventually encounter these kindred and will likely be at odds with them as they try to carve out a new territory. This campaign could also make good use of my revised citizen type. After all, a colonizing force needs more than warriors and wizard. Specialists of all types will be required to conquer the new world and the players will be forced to use more than swords and spells."

9888,"She had a few other funny stories like that, but she began to share more about her husband. Since I had the time, I listened. She said they were married for 57 years and that he was her best friend. After he got sick, he asked if he could go home to die beside his wife. He died in her arms. Her husband died a few years after her oldest son died. Hearing these things made me tear up, but Polly just smiled. She is confident that she will see them both again someday and realizes that life is short for all of us."

Maybe not as bright as a brand new pair, but they are trying... and I like that my shoes still try and that they are still beautiful and wonderful even although they might be a little old."

9892,"1. Eliminate corruption and patronage. As has been pointed out, delays are in themselves a cause for corruption because people will seek to use nefarious means to avoid them, such as pay to put a file on top of the pile. While efficiency builds up, it is necessary to take a strong stand against any kind of corruption and patronage at all levels. The best way to do this is to issue a stern warning and take action against anyone found to be flouting the rules."

Talking of canopy, you can now appreciate tree top views by walking on the tree-top bridge. While I was walking there, a hummingbird flew and stopped at a fruit tree. A few moments later, another hummingbird flew by. Really wish I brought along the telephoto lens. A close-up would have been sweet precious memories. Moments like this only came by once in a while."

It does not cost much to post a file to a blog -- as PatLit and the IPKat demonstrate. Charged appropriately, it could even cover its own costs. It is exactly the sort of project that an institute like IBIL might take on as a pilot scheme. With the arrival of an advocate for open justice like Sir Robin Jacob, fresh from the Patents Court and Court of Appeal, IBIL would in fact be the perfect vehicle for demonstrating a UK pilot scheme of open justice on the web."

However, if anyone who rides a Large-size frame is in the market for a smoking deal on an amazing triplet, look no further. This thing is easily worth twice what its listed for and the specs are tailored for adults, noting the stoker compartments are a generous 29″."

If you are thinking of marrying a woman who cannot define respect, and doesn’t know how to give you respect, then you are going to be in for a world of hurt. The more she views marriage as a joint project with specific goals and external challenges, the more understanding and support you will get. No one wants to fly a plane with someone who doesn’t know how to fly a plane, fix a plane or navigate a plane. The more she knows about men and marriage, the better it will go for you – and the children."
9931,"The Heavenly Hash Egg is a recent discovery for me. They get sent to my office from one of our remote workers in Texas. What this thing consists of is a fluffy marshmallowy goo, laced with almonds (big and small), and covered in chocolate. If the StayPuft Marshmallow Man picked his nose, this is what would be at the end of his finger when he pulled it out. My only complaint is that this thing falls apart easily, making an oogie mess at times. But the chocolate has a nice snap to it with serious goo in the center. The almonds set it off. The only thing that would make this thing better is if they actually put hash in it. Then again, that would probably be a waste of hash."

They have seed banks (all run by illiterate dalit women) and they give seeds to farmers to grow these local crops. The only condition is that they have to bring back twice as many seeds the next year, so the seed banks keep growing. It's just really great. I can't do it justice.

While most crime books are almost wholly plot-driven, Indridason’s novels weave together story lines that echo and refract off one another in an almost poetic way. I think these books will stand the test of time and deserve to be read for their underlying psychological themes as well as for the satisfying resolution of the mystery. Many crime books are only fit to be read and cast aside, but Indridason’s linger in the memory, summoning the reader to return, re-read and re-think."

9945,"The famous New York Times was amongst the many offenders continuing to run dozens of heavily biased and guilt presuming articles almost to the point where the case, and their reporting of it, imploded in front of them. Times Sports reporter Selena Roberts was guilty of some of the more intemperate, hate infused, and prejudiced reporting in the early stages. Amongst other things Roberts asserted that ""something happened on March 13"" without acknowledging that this was taking the unproven charges of the prosecution and announcing them as fact. Furthermore, Roberts published false information about the case through the Times, such as ""Players have been forced to give up their DNA, but to the dismay of investigators, none have come forward to reveal an eyewitness account."" In fact, the captains' March 28, 2006 statement and the defense attorneys' subsequent press conference both described the captains' cooperation with police, and both occurred before Roberts penned her column. The Times never ran a correction. (Source Wikipedia)"

9947,"Dunollie Castle is built on an ancient lava block next to the coast. There are no easy approaches to get to it. The block is about 4 to 5 stories high. Add a stone wall around the edges and then within that a four story castle. The brick work is lovely, all black stone, fiting together a mosaic of stone. The cellar is on the ground floor. There is then a steep, uneven staircase to the next floor which is open to the sky. Once this would have been the great hall. The two stories above were the Laird’s chamber, the private rooms and above that, the defensive roof and walkways. All with a beautiful view of the surrounding area. The building is covered with ivy, which is slowly destroying the castle. The ivy places rootlets into the walls and makes holes and sucks moister away. To kill ivy, you need to kill it from the top and bottom at the same time a year before the restoration work is to be done and you must do restoration work otherwise the dead ivy causes damage."

Utilising Sorronda's canon of staple shapes - the voluminous tops, the trapeze, tent-like dresses, the ruffle embelishments - this collection seemed lighter somehow. For Spring/Summer it will work well, all those colours play off the brightness of Australian heat, and the oversized, overblown shapes won't go astray when it starts to get warmer."
