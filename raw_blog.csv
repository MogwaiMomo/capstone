34,"Such were the differences between the regimes usually called fascist that a really adequate answer would be a book-length enterprise so let me just list my conclusions followed by a few explanatory notes: In addition to Hitler, Mussolini and Peron, the true Fascists of the pre-war period were Dollfuss in Austria, Pilsudski in Poland, Mosley in Britain and Chiang Kai Shek in China. They were all clearly both socialists and nationalists and to varying degrees had many other trappings of Mussolini's Fascism too -- such as militarism and a liking for uniforms. Franco in Spain and Salazar in Portugal were only semi-Fascist. Tojo in Japan, Horthy in Hungary, Antonescu in Romania, Pavelic in Croatia were simply nationalists rather than Fascists. In more recent times Papadopoulos in Greece, Pinochet in Chile and Suharto in Indonesia were just common or garden variety military dictators. Military government is of course the rule rather than the exception throughout history. It was even the rule rather than the exception in ancient Greece. Pinochet, Suharto and Papadopoulos are sometimes mentioned as Fascists purely because they had significant far-Left opponents. It may be noted that their cultural backgrounds are quite different: Catholic, Muslim and Orthodox.",1272

In other words, she paints an ugly picture of cool church and then says in essence, “Look how ugly that picture is!” For you philosophical types…it’s a straw man argument (i.e. a false argument – you can go deeper…Google it). That said, each style of church faces many of the same dangers…cool, uncool, contemporary, traditional, etc. For me, it’s not about cool or not cool. It’s about faithful or unfaithful. I love that we have multiple versions of worship. Each worship service in the church, regardless of worship style,s seeking to be faithful to following Christ.",689

133,"No, folks, those were child’s play. From 2004 to 2008 we experienced the biggest commodities bubble the world had ever seen. If you looked to the top 25 traded commodities, you found prices had doubled over the period. For the top 8, the price inflation was much more spectacular. As I wrote “According to an analysis by market strategist Frank Veneroso, over the course of the 20th century, there were only 13 instances in which the price of a single commodity rose by 500 percent or more. For example, the price of sugar rose 641 percent in 1920, and in the same year, the price of cotton rose 538 percent. In 1947, there was a commodities boom across three commodities: pork bellies (1,053 percent), soybean oil (797 percent), and soybeans (558 percent). During the Hunt brothers episode, in 1980, silver prices were driven up by 3,813 percent. (A crack up boom)",865

138,"And this is the problem with Rand Paul’s answer to Rachel Maddow. His belief is that if a restaurant discriminates against its customers, the people will stop shopping there. The restaurant will then be forced to change its discriminatory policy or to close. In Paul’s mind, there’s no need for the imprecise and clumsy power of government to address the issue. The market will regulate itself. Yet Paul’s assumption in all of this is a healthy civic community. It is only when we have a healthy sense of connection to our neighbors that we will wield the power of the free market healthily. But as it stands, we are well aware of the negative effects of pornography on women, yet we go on buying. Likewise, we are aware of the abusive nature of what Naomi Wolf calls The Beauty Myth, a lie continually peddled by cosmetic companies. But we go on buying.

The benefit of this is that these characters become stronger and more developed but if you give them too much freedom, they and your novel will self destruct. Believe me, I’ve been there. The other day I was reading a blog post about an author who was allowing her protagonist to do what he wanted to do. Okay so far, right? Well, apparently, she gave him slightly too much freedom and he wandered away from her original plot and she thoughtlessly went along with it until her protagonist wound up in a high security prison with concrete floors, an amplitude of armed guards and no foreseeable escape. Now I cannot imagine what the author can do from there, but if you give your character the freedom of thinking or themselves, be sure to enforce some law on your protagonist and do not let him or her stray from the original plot as it could destroy your novel. So if George decides that he wants to hide under a desk and allow the antagonists to kill his friends, well, George is an idiot and you must force him to stand up and fight, no matter how much he remonstrates.",1199

In most communities there is a great lack of spending power in terms of the national currency but local consumer power could be created by introducing a local complementary currency.

I wondered if it were a joke. Surely publishers don’t find writers like this? Doesn’t it happen the other way around? I checked with Jo-Anne and she re-assured me that it wasn’t a joke, and that she too had received this message. After making contact with Dave, I told him how amazing his timing was. I truly believe that Mum had arrived in heaven, as strong-willed and outspoken as ever, and had been tugging at God’s sleeve relentlessly asking him to give me a break.

So, what Dr. King is arguing is that just as there is a law of gravity that describes the inevitable relationship of attraction between two masses, there are laws of morality that describe the inevitable relationships between right and wrong, between good and evil.",620

With all my New Weird reading this year it was high time I delved into VanderMeer's world of mushroom men and odd occurrences. Overall, this is a very, very strange book with not only content, but style as VanderMeer never sticks to one for long.

For the last 300 years, where ever in the Muslim world there were resistance movements, Muslims were defeated. The need of these resistance movements arose because of the demise of the Ummah as a whole. Only a few valiant, brave men like Tipu Sultan or Siraj-ud-Dola returned those debts which were not even due on them. Because of the collective faults of the Ummah, they had to bear the brunt of the downfall of the Muslims. They had the option to live for 100 years the life of a jackal but these men of Allah preferred the life of a lion even if it was for one day. They lived like lions and due to their valour, succeeded in this world and the next.

Sadly though, the First World War deprived him of any chance to play Test cricket. After the war, he tried his luck across the Tasman Sea but had to wait till the age of 33 to make his Test debut. He remains the only man to take 200 Test wickets after playing his first Test post-30. He took almost 6 wickets per game in an era dominated by batsmen, bowling to the likes of Hobbs, Hammond, Sutcliffe, Headley and Nourse. Amazingly, in his last series, playing at the age of 44, Grimmett took 33 wickets in 3 Tests at an average of 11.",714

The Dutch are, indeed, very friendly and easy going, and the atmosphere at the milongas is very relaxed. It is so relaxed you could probably stand on your head in a corner and no one would be scandalized – they probably wouldn´t notice, and if they did, would dismiss it as insignificant. That´s something you learn quickly in a city like Amsterdam, and I own it is a quality I like very much. But when it gets to being invited by really good dancers – I don´t know.

They have lived in open rebellion; they have done evil with both hands; they have gone from bad to worse; they have turned back to sin even after they have smarted for it, and have therefore for a while been forced to leave it. They have broken the law, and trampled on the gospel. They have refused proclamations of mercy, and have persisted in ungodliness. How can they be forgiven and justified? Their fellowmen, despairing of them, say, “They are hopeless cases.” Even Christians look upon them with sorrow rather than with hope. But not so their God. He, in the splendour of his electing grace having chosen some of them before the foundation of the world, will not rest till He has justified them, and made them to be accepted in the Beloved. Is it not written, “Whom he did predestine, them he also called: and whom he called he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified”? Thus you see there are some whom the Lord resolves to justify: why should not you and I be of the number? (“All of Grace”)",1122

There also appears to be an expectation on the part of many talented and successful Chinese entrepreneurs that, since they are creators of employment and prosperity at the local and national level, the various measures of enforcement that might be brought against them will be more in the manner of measures of admonition and light compensation than serious impediments to their continued trading.",1042

Historical movies and TV shows seem to be just as formative in conversion to the religion that is HF: a 70s “Six Wives of Henry VIII” BBC mini-series might seem dated and slow-paced compared to Showtime's sleek and racy “Tudor”s show with Jonathan Rhys Meyers, but it converted thousands (including my mother) into Tudorphiles, just as “Downton Abbey” is converting thousands today into Anglophiles.",823

Much of it simply escapes as methane over its life cycle as it is drilled and transported. Most natural gas is methane. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas in its own right. It has substantially more powerful greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide by many multiples but over a somewhat shorter time period because it lasts in the atmosphere as methane for about 10 years. Once carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere it is there, for all practical purposes, permanently. Some companies flare their escaping waste methane to destroy it but Dr. Ingraffea reports that others like Shell have a policy not to.

But, not having chapters, or any other mark indicating a break, is pretty rare. Especially for Stephen King. Most of his books not only have chapters, but have numbered sections within the chapter to even further break things up. I’m not sure what the reasoning for going chapterless was, but it does make the whole story kind of flow a little differently. It’s like one big long narrative of what happened “Once upon a time”.

Over several years I have taught this technique at my special AT and movement classes for pregnant women, and my experience suggests that it is effective. Of course, in the absence of a scientific statistical study it cannot be ruled out that the cases where it seems to have worked were just a series of lucky turns. Proper research will be required in order to reach firmer conclusions. Be that as it may, most childbirth educators will agree that these movements have several beneficial effects during pregnancy and in childbirth, irrespective of the baby’s position.",866

Check out the beautiful gossamer shimmer of “Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others”: not only does it create a vivid atmosphere, they give a sense of yearning beauty that Morrissey’s tongue-in-cheek lyric fails to capture. The vibrato-rich, glossy black solo by Bernard Butler in Suede’s “The Asphalt World” similarly creates a world of epic longing and tortured poetry which redouble the effect of verses, which verge on the absurd. (Butler wanted the song (and solo) to be longer – I often think he was right. Structurally, the song is similar to Pink Floyd’s “Echoes” – itself over 17 minutes). And how about the solo in Television’s “Marquee Moon”? Just savour the guitar interplay.",829

As Grant Tinker, then head of NBC-TV, observed, television “is an advertising supported medium, and to the extent that support falls out, programming will change.”",778

I was dealing with the teachers and with Jeremy every day, not just in the morning or at bed time. When I took Jeremy to school, the stress stopped for my husband, but not for me or his teachers. After speaking with numerous wives, I’ve discovered that the husbands don’t believe it, or Want to believe it. It appears that because men feel that they must be strong in every situation and must cope many obstacles in life, and that having a son that is facing problems is just too much to bear. Most of the dads of the boys with Sid are in denial at first. The wives tend to have to deal with finding out what the issues are all by themselves by researching, talking and finding solutions. Many of the husbands fight the wives to the end until the wife ultimately convinces her mate to “just speak with an expert”. In one case I know, the father uses the excuse, “he’s just like I was” so he assumes it is okay. Meanwhile, everyone along with his wife is going crazy having to deal with his child. My friend is of the mindset that if there Is help available, then she’s going to get it! In reality, many of these men are right, because the kid Is just like them… And if there would have been help for their own mothers way back when, then the moms more than likely would have taken it instead of suffering straight through it and of procedure it would have made everything easier on the child.

2224,"the Bible is divinely inspired, but it was interpreted, God’s message was interpreted, by fallible human beings, who were constrained by their knowledge of facts about the universe, for instance, when they wrote. God, who created everything, knew that the size of stars and God knew that the earth was not the center of the universe. And when the Bible says that the stars would fall on earth as though they were little twinkling things, obviously that’s not factual. And so I believe the basic thrust of the Bible, the basic message of the Bible, is epitomized in the life of Christ and in the teachings of Jesus Christ. And I also believe that there is nothing in the Old Testament that contradicts the basic teachings of Christ for peace, justice, humility, love and so forth, and each person’s proper relationship with other human beings and also a relationship with God. So I believe in the miracles of the Bible. I believe that Jesus was come from a virgin birth. I believe Christ died for our sins on the cross. I believe He was resurrected and that we are promised, if we have faith in Christ through the grace of God, that we will inherit eternal life. I believe that God loved the world so much that He gave His only begotten Son. I believe those things, but I know that there are some things as a scientist—my background is in nuclear physics—there’re some things that weren’t understood by the writers of the Bible. I just ignored those",1448

The first part is named for Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and takes place at her wedding reception at the massive estate of her sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsborough), and brother-in-law, John (Kiefer Sutherland). The reception is fraught with tension as Justine and her new husband, Michael (Alexander Skarsgard), have arrived late to the reception, Justine's divorced parents (John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling) are openly feuding, Justine's mother is vocal in her disapproval of the marriage and, in fact, the idea of marriage (""""Enjoy it while it lasts,"""" she tells them in her toast), and Justine's increasingly alienating behaviour not only enrages the wedding planner (Udo Kier) to the point where he can't even bring himself to look at her, but it also brings her marriage to a halt before it even really gets started.

2389,"T: I think there is so much possibility of perfecting each little detail in the studio, that the soul of the music can die if everything is over analyzed and microcosm’d. When music is recorded, live or in the studio, its kind of hard to explain but I feel that the soul of the music is being recorded and captured, and that hopefully it can be relayed to the listener. When people get goosebumps listening to music maybe that’s a small part of the soul of the recording speaking to them; when there is emotional attachment with the listener with a given recording. What is it about Joplin, or Hendrix, or Billie Holiday, or even further back Robert Johnson, that continues to move people? It is something that transcends time and space and just continues to hit home with the listener. Coming back to the perfection of the recording studio, many inexperienced producers and engineers don’t have the smarts to stop! They keep going for perfection, and there is no soul in perfection. What makes a good record is the ability to capture that elusive feeling that a band can make. The first take, the guide track vocal may not be perfect, but it could be more emotionally moving then the perfect final vocal. Always go back to where you started to make sure you’ve still got that thing that moved you when you first heard the song, the performance.",1345

This year, after a number of EPs and minor releases, Broughton finally returns with a proper follow-up. Outbreeding is a very different record from Broughton's debut, replacing that album's lengthy quasi-improvisations with a series of short, lushly arranged folk-rock tunes, slotting Broughton's mannered vocals and wry wordplay into much fuller arrangements than those found on the sparse Complete Guide. There's an arch, aloof quality to Broughton's carefully enunciated intonations, and he takes clear delight in drawing out certain syllables, rolling his R's and stretching vowels into eccentric shapes. He clearly loves saying """"fuck"""" so much that it comes out like """"fook;"""" he savors the shapes of words until they're stretched out of joint. This quirky vocal style draws attention to the subtle cleverness of the lyrics, like the sprightly punning of """"Ain't Got No Sole"""" or the tongue-twisting eloquence of these lines from """"Staying True"""": """"my body is so crap at staying true/ to my will and the way I'd like to be/ my father's fist is a brick in my heart."""" Broughton has refrained from simply repeating himself. With a bonafide masterpiece of droning minimalist folk under his belt he now turns his attention to wry pub pop, the obvious irony in his tone not disguising the equally obvious emotion underpinning his elliptical musings.

Mahajan recounts how he posed almost naked, next to a tempting model wearing not much more than him, for Canteen magazine in an effort to overturn the modern writer's reputation for frowsiness. ('Authors present themselves as bright, sincere, humble, hardworking people, like Republican presidential candidates. “It’s all just revision and craft,” one says. “I couldn’t have done it without my mom,” offers another. “My three years of MFA were the best of my life and I would do them again if I could,” says a third.) When you read this piece you'll also find alongside it photographs of some of the bright lights of south Asian writing today, looking like they've just emerged from the pages of Vanity Fair.

Mercury rules the sign of Gemini and is found in Taurus, in conjunction with Jupiter and in aspect to Saturn and to newly retrograde Venus. Both thought and emotion are brought to the fore and in combination, granting you an unusual opportunity to come to a better set of ideas concerning your earthly situation. Since Venus is exactly trine Saturn, your love-life and relationship energy is inward and somewhat stifled, but intensified. In addition to the important relationships in your life, you are seeking to concretize as well your dreams and your artistic impulses.",719

2504,"Inaura's career was actually a very unfortunate case of multiple mistakes. For starters, they were launched as being part of the ill-fated Romo scene in the mid-nineties. Romo was an eighties pop revivalist movement launched by Melody Maker which was supposed to take over the waning lead Britpop had shown the country. Sadly, despite involving a shedload of interesting eccentrics and pretentious buffoons who would certainly have livened up the rather dour meat-and-potatoes music scene of the time, the majority of them really didn't deliver the goods musically, and the scene was quickly buried after a showcase tour which the public chose to completely ignore. Sadly for Inaura, not only were they left off the showcase (instead being given a nationwide support slot with The Human League) they were also one of the only bands amongst it who were astonishing live and also knew their way around a tune - a case of """"the exception which proves the rule"""".",957

It’s far less simple—or simplistic—than going to the opposite extreme; it also works better in the real world, where hard binary oppositions are a good deal less common than muddily complex issues in which moderation is inevitably a better strategy than extremism.",890

2725,"To put the matter very simply—did you ever hear of Mr. Rowland Hill’s illustration of the cat and the sow? I will give it in my own fashion, to illustrate our Savior’s expressive words—“Ye must be born again”. Do you see that cat? What a cleanly creature she is! How cleverly she washes herself with her tongue and her paws! It is quite a pretty sight! Did you ever see a sow do that? No, you never did. It is contrary to its nature. It prefers to wallow in the mire. Go and teach a sow to wash itself, and see how little success you would gain. It would be a great sanitary improvement if swine would be clean. Teach them to wash and clean themselves as the cat has been doing! Useless task. You may by force wash that sow, but it hastens to the mire, and is soon as foul as ever. The only way in which you can get a sow to wash itself is to transform it into a cat; then it will wash and be clean, but not till then! Suppose that transformation to be accomplished, and then what was difficult or impossible is easy enough; the swine will henceforth be fit for your parlor and your hearth-rug. So it is with an ungodly man; you cannot force him to do what a renewed man does most willingly; you may teach him, and set him a good example, but he cannot learn the art of holiness, for he has no mind to it; his nature leads him another way. When the Lord makes a new man of him, then all things wear a different aspect. So great is this change that I once heard a convert say, “Either all the world is changed, or else I am.” The new nature follows after right as naturally as the old nature wanders after wrong. What a blessing to receive such a nature! Only the Holy Ghost can give it.",1686

Sometimes, as in Julius Caesar’s De Bello Gallico, the names of the native deities are erased altogether, and he only speaks of the “Gaulish Mercury” rather than (as seems the most likely) “Lugus,” “Lugus-Mercury,” or “Mercury-Lugus.” We also get “localized” Roman gods, like Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus (whose altar in the Romano-British site of Vindolanda is shown above), which is the syncretistic and more widespread version of the Ba’al cult at Doliche.

2780,"So now the choice was down to rubber mats vs. rubber tiles. This was an easy decision as well. My half of the garage measure 14 ft long x 10 ft wide. Both rubber mats and tiles are sold in packages of 4 ft x 6 ft, meaning that 4 would give me a workout space 12 ft long x 8 ft wide. The rubber mats are a better option because they are 1 solid piece and lay on the ground well because of there weight, not to mention 4 pieces would connect pretty easily. They are also made of a higher quality of rubber. The problem-the run about $60 a piece for a 4 x 6 piece AND I NEED 4!!!! THAT’S $260!!!! Needless to say-a little of if my budget for flooring. So I went with my other option-packs of rubber mats that consist of 6 2 ft x 2 ft tiles (one of the """"before"""" pics actually has the flooring in its packaging). I’ve dealt with 1 ft x 1 ft tiles and had my concerned because the tiles would move around a lot and break apart sometimes. However I was pretty sure the moving around was due to the fact that it was a small number of tiles which equals less weight and they were sitting on top of hard wood flooring. As for them breaking apart, my thoughts are that it was due to there only being a few tiles (less stability and support), the smaller size of the tiles, and not all of them having border pieces. I need 4 packs of the rubber tiles, which wasn’t a problem considering they only cost $19-a total of $80 with tax!!!! Even though the rubber mats are a little better quality, I’m not really worried because A)-my gym is a HOME gym, not commercial and B) I plan on taking care of it properly!",1594

It can look like bipolar disorder, and is often misdiagnosed and treated as such.

Knowing we would have a hard time growing anything underneath should we attempt to do so, it seemed like an obvious (not to mention maintenance free) solution to have a concrete slab poured. We ended up finding a concrete company who also did decorative concrete as well, so we had a stamped concrete patio poured at the same time. We spend a lot of time outside and knew this would be a worthwhile investment. I happened to be home over the several days that they poured the patio and it was really neat to see the whole process. I will admit though, that as they were pouring the cement into the framework, I was freaking out because it looked nothing like the color of concrete I chose (that I spent hours agonizing over).

But the Shepherd was written by Hermas in the city of Rome quite recently, in our own times, when his brother Pius occupied the bishop’s chair in the church of the city of Rome; and therefore it may be read indeed, but cannot be given out to the people in the church either among the prophets, since their number is complete, or among the apostles at the end of the times.”[94] Clearly the early church had several leaders who thought very poorly of pseudepigraphal works and fought against their acceptance in the church.",1605

Aren really wants to do the right thing, and strives to be “good”, in a society that would rather hide and look out for its own self-interest at the expense of a sacrificed few. Looking at Aren makes me wonder how many people would be willing to take his role in OUR society, as it grows more and more individually-centered. Mikasa is a really strong female character, whose growth was a direct result of various childhood problems; I love how she took tragedy and made herself stronger as a result.

Without the character concerns Jenkins is probably a top 15 talent and being argued over who is a better corner back with Morris Claiborne. The Rams knew what they were doing when they traded away the chance at Claiborne. After they traded the 45th pick to the Bears they took Isiah Pead from Cincinnati. A running back that is only a part time back. The Rams need running back depth so this was an acceptable pick but not a home-run pick for being in the second round. Third round pick I’m happy with. The Rams drafted Trumaine Johnson, a corner back out of Montana. If things don’t work out with Jenkins and the Rams have another season full of injuries with their defensive backs they should be able to trust the talent of Trumaine Johnson. He is a second round talent and adds depth to the team. I trust that new coach Jeff Fisher can develop the talent he has picked in the first three rounds. The Rams finally have a coach that has been around the league and has been successful. He has gotten teams to win more games than other teams and he’s done it with less talent. See Vince Young.",1284

I am over that situation, but emotional pain is not something easily erased. It’s not as simple as saying you’re sorry- some cases of “making it up” require action(s) and not words, and this is exactly what my old friend meant. I don’t have an answer for her – I told her that I’ll have to think about that and email her in one day or so. If I come up with an answer, I’ll let you all know, too. And, who knows, maybe he also was hurt in the end – I hope not, I made sure to give him lots of love and an exorbitant amount of good sex whenever we could have it! Lol. If I did hurt him, he doesn’t seem to be the kind of man that you could make that up to, even if you wanted to.

You know life is good when you can appreciate a little bad weather or maybe it is really true that I was born when the earth was cooling. According to the newspapers and tv all fireworks displays, the parade and all 4th of July festivities have been cancelled, well so much for that, part of the child hiding in this Old Model '37 Body, I cant even get the muse musing on how to come up with an alternative, maybe next weekend. The Queen and the Queen Mother took the Grand Duchess to Church Camp in Big Sandy, Texas alllllllllllllllllll the way across Texas to just 80 miles west of the Louisanna State Line. We went first to Queens's Castle in Eastland, and stayed the night. Then on down the trail again for another 4 hours to Big Sandy. The Grand Duchess had to check in by 3:00 p.m. and boy was she excited. We got her there and checked in and looked over the camp and """"store"""" and left money in her account. The dormitories were big buildings with open screened windows around all four sides, no air conditioners in sight. I would tell you it was hot, but the flies and other flying insects could only soar about 4 inches off the ground, the air was so thick. Big Sandy is in the Piney Woods of Texas. The town is about a blink in size, blink and when you have open your eyes you missed your turn for I-20. The Queen and Queen Mother left her for a week of uninterrupted pleasure for the camper and the the Queen and I. For the first day of freedom, the Queen, and I wandered around the castle (Eastland) in pj's and read, and napped, the next day we waited on the plummer and then went to Weatherford, a 2 blinker town and looked around at little stores on the square. I indulged my whimsey and went to the bead store (of course) and on down the street to where the Queen has made friends with the people that own the store. Then on to the Tesky's Western store in the 2 blinker town, and boy did we find a sale, they had two racks with 95% off of the merchandise can you believe it. The Queen spent $200 and saved $1200. An example I bought a dress for $7.80 the original price was $159.95. Now why I did now buy the other one I dont know, it was to small, but my thinking cap was askew and I didnt thing about the material in the dress being used another way for all sorts of ideas. Of course I have kicked myself several times, and now try not to think about the stupid thing I did of not picking up stuff for the materials to be used. Before the ten days were up, I felt like we were gypsies running up and down the highway from 2 blinkers to cities like Ft. Worth. As the time grew less and less, I began to pack my treasures and trash and stash of goodies and found that I had a car full. We treked back to camp to pick up the two girls and came back to the castle, to clean it up and close up for a couple of weeks. Then back to our own 2 1/2 blinker, well maybe 3 blinker because we do have Michaels, Hobby Lobby , Lowes and Home Depot here. The trip was really a fun time by all I hope.

3286,"5 out of 5 – Violence – Considering that the book is composed mostly of warfare during the village’s besiege, that explains why not only does this segment receive a large number, but also why this book holds the biggest death count of the Bone ennealogy (series of nine works). Most of the book pays attention to the war, not even bothering to add words, in examples like Gran’ma smacking a rat creature with a long stick. After their trek to the dragon grounds, Fone Bone & Thorn accidentally awaken the dragons, causing them to erupt from beneath the village ground. The mythical story of the dragon queen Mim is told, and we see her burn down in flames in what is one of the most upsetting scenes in the book. In several illustrations, you can see dead bodies of both man and rat scattered about the grounds. (WARNING: The spoilers are about to come in! I am really spoiling it!) Thorn is attacked & trapped by Kingdok when he bites into her leg and prevents her from touching the Crown. She then proceeds to use a sword to go through his skull, killing him once and for all. Briar attacks her own sister (again, Gran’ma Ben) with her scythe, and she is stopped by Lucius from truly killing her. As soon as Fone Bone successfully touches the Crown, Briar’s body bursts in an energy supernova, killing both her and Lucius, ending the war. A few pages later, you can see her body burnt to an ashy crisp. Before this, Briar apparently kills a great number of people during the war, including the Vedu leader Tarsil. The same guy unmasks himself before he goes, revealing a gnarly scar that nearly runs across his face. Fone Bone & Thorn apparently got socked before the events of the book, so Fone has a swollen-shut eye for almost the entire book.",1748

He writes, ‘My memory– the memory of a scientific man, if you’ll forgive me– is bulging with naivetes of overbearing that I have heard about philosophy…’ I think that N- is here casting himself as the philologist viewing the happenings in ‘philosophy’ from outside, ‘Most frequently I found among young scholars that what lay behind the arrogant contempt for philosophy was the bed aftereffect of — a philosopher to whom they now denied allegiance on the whole without, however, having broken the spell of his cutting evaluation of other philosophers…’ I think this is a very interesting diagnosis, and probably has much to recommend it. I think N- is pointing out a tendency among philosophers to heavily inflect their work with denouncements of most other philosophers, clearing the ground for what they will put forth by laying waste to the history of the discipline (almost the opposite strategy to much of scholarship and science!). So, perhaps some of those people who ‘know just enough to be dangerous’, read Hegel or someone like that and buy in when they’re young. As they grow, they grow apart from their philosophical mentor.

The film features Fritz Klein, a well-known Lincoln actor, as the President, showing the resolve to win the war to the end, and refusing to leave the capital, despite the threat of Confederate invasion. Klein’s portrayal is subdued, but also shows the talent of a man who knows Lincoln inside and out, and gives the film’s best performance. If you have not seen the film, I encourage you to do so. Despite its miniscule $500,000 budget (Which shows at times), the performances and thrilling battle footage more than make up for it.",792

3560,"JS: I completely agree with you Jack. Horror writers are some of the most passionate out there. Writing good horror is hard. Really hard. Sure, you can gore things up and make a passage uncomfortable to read but can you really entice those reactions of actual fear out of a reader? Gore is uncomfortable but fear is primal. It’s not an easy feat to elicit fear mainly because not everyone reacts the same way to the same thing. I’m a firm believer that you have to immerse yourself in your work in order to get those reactions. As a horror writer, you owe it to your readers. Horror is defined in its plainest terms as an intense feeling of fear, shock or disgust. While I’m writing I like to build on those emotions, sometimes alone and sometimes in harmony. I find that the intense build to a singular moment can be a bigger pay off than injecting horrific moments just for horror’s sake.

Bristol is the same woman who has been a proponent of abstinence-only education. Now the “ambassador” of abstinence, who has had a child out of wedlock, is going to live with a boyfriend of over a year, all the while proclaiming herself to be a “Born-Again-Virgin.” It is unclear at this point if this “Trial Marriage” will be successful. Gino may not be happy being married to a “Born-Again-Virgin.” My only hope is that Bristol discloses to Tripp’s preschool teacher that she is a virgin, and that Gino is not Tripp’s dad, his dad is the one that “stole” her virginity during the camping trip, and that it is purely coincidence that Tripp shares his name with the woman who has written a book about her pimp, Grandpa Palin.",1017

It is certainly not the reality of patient culture today: physicians are regularly disrespected, personal responsibility is a joke and if things don’t go perfectly, a lawsuit is waiting right around the corner (again, there are obviously exceptions, but it is a cultural trend). This cultural shift is made possible due to something that Brooks points out in his op-ed piece.

The magician has the same awkward second-guess step and toe-tilting rigidity and balance that Mr. Hulot possessed. His hands always find their way to his hips or outstretched innocently behind him. The magician is a lovingly molded caricature. Where the characters in Triplets and Old Lady were hilariously grotesque exaggerations, the characters of The Illusionist seem to be sculpted with more compassion.

Most who are adherents to some form of religion would be outraged to be told that each of us are capable of sending a piece of our astral matter to a distant location… and then reabsorbing it and reviewing what it saw and sensed, like a movie playing on the mind’s eye. And the inevitable reaction of being in league with “the devil” – by whatever name he’s called this month – is to be expected at some point, without fail. It is beyond most people’s experience, aside from the sleep period, where they are truly aware of who they are. That’s not a judgment, just an observation.

What this meant was that any conceivable withdrawal of those forces would have to take place, eventually, on the basis of a process that was at least partly political. This in turn could not happen if the PIRA was seen by the British as a viciously sectarian murder gang, as it would have been impossible for the British government to negotiate with such a force. When loyalist sectarian killing flared up again in the late 80s, PIRA members were expressly forbidden from retaliating in kind for this reason. However, there were no similar restrictions on the behaviour of loyalist paramilitaries, who were fighting not to overturn a status quo, but to preserve it.

Until recently, most people still knew there must be some reason why a sexual relationship between a man and a woman was different to other human sexual relationships. Sadly, though, such is the society that we live in – in which children often take second place to rather self-indulgent adult romances – that it appears many people in the West now assume that the only purpose of marriage is for the “good of the spouses” (regardless of their gender).",724

The truth is, it may take weeks or months before trust is built and our child can genuinely show us love in return. It’s made me think a lot about what Biblical love is. I think in our culture we’ve reduced love to squishy feelings and sentiments, to hearts and teddy bears. We throw 1 Corinthians 13 in every wedding ceremony because of it’s romantic, flowery language about speaking in tongues of men and angels, but we never really stop to consider what a hard line it is to walk.

There was also talk of Medgar Evers College buying the site, as well as a bank branch. Still, three years later, it seems the original plan (8 stories, 63 units, gym - was this the one Tish was talking about? - and ground floor retail) is back on the table.

Coming to the Balboa December 2nd will be Jason Cohn and Bill Jersey's Eames: The Architect and The Painter. I had heard about the Charles and Ray Eames's marriage and professional partnership in a past podcast (the name of which escapes me), so I was ready for the most revealing aspect of Cohn and Jersey's documentary; that is, how important Ray Eames's work was to the success of their designs. They were a couple speeding past the Zeitgeist of the 50's, having to negotiate the respect Ray wanted and Charles wanted for Ray within the patriarchal narratives demanded of the times. The television clip where the hostess can't seem to integrate the female half of this couple is a very valuable moment of archival retrieval. Eames: The Architect and The Painter is an example of the value and necessity of what is often called 'revisionist history', a term sadly intended negatively by too many mindless talking heads. Much history is 'revisionist history' in that it is the applying of recently excavated information to create a new narrative that is hopefully more representative of what actually happened and why. In this way, Eames: The Architect and The Painter brings a lathe to refine the record of the impact of the Eames studio. It's no longer just Charles who gets a seat at the table since he wasn't alone in the creation of those seats and tables.",1498

We have a strong sense of pride about this”. Sangen also says that the cove is equivalent of a slaughterhouse anywhere else in the world, a naturally gory place that is usually closed off from public view. The major difference here is that most slaughterhouses around the world have laws regarding the treatment of animals. These laws require the animals to be stunned unconscious prior to the slaughtering so that they feel no pain. The dolphin drive hunts in Taiji are conducted with a complete disregard for animal welfare, and there are no restrictions on capture or killing methods, including time to death.",890

The other part of the story, which in some sense is probably what the story is really about, is the idea of good versus evil. In the process of recovering and rebuilding after the virus has run its course, there are two main people that serve as figureheads. The first is Mother Abigail, a 106 year old woman living in Nebraska. Several people have dreams about her and are drawn to her home. Eventually she and her followers move to Colorado. They form what would be considered the “good” side. On the other side is Randal Flagg. He sets up his main base in Las Vegas (fitting, right?) and his group is what would be considered the “bad” side. Although, there is really no reason why either group is good or bad, other than because of the particular figure head they aligned with, and of course, in some cases, the past actions of those people give a little insight into why they may have aligned with their particular leader.",1037

4072,"Another friend reminded me of the importance of the staff in the story of the Exodus when the Israelites were brought out of slavery and traveled through the wilderness. The staff was used to perform many mighty acts of God in front of Pharoah and represented His authority and power. Even though Pharoah’s magicians could perform some wonders and signs, when the staffs were turned into snakes, Moses’ snake ate the others. In the same way, the enemy is a real force at work, but God is infinitely stronger and more powerful and will be victorious! As we serve the Lord, many will see His power and that He alone is King. The staff was used in the parting of the Red Sea; when Moses raised it (as the Lord said), the sea parted. When we exalt Jesus in our lives, obstacles will be removed, seas will part, problems will disappear! Just as the staff was turned into a serpent and high and lifted up when the people had been bitten by poisonous snakes after sinning and to be saved they had to look at it, we have to look at Jesus and His death (when He was high and lifted up on the cross) and believe in Him in order to be saved. Aaron’s budding staff represents all of us who are connected to the Vine, Jesus, and are alive in Him and bearing fruit through the power of the Holy Spirit in us. Moses held up the staff (with the help of Aaron and Ur) in order to ensure victory in battle for Joshua and the Israelites. We must all work together, doing our different parts and continuing to rely on God’s power – the power of the staff – to defeat the enemy. I could go on and on…",1579

4090,"Rapace remains the singular highlight of the series as she elevates her Salander performance taking the character to places only hinted at in the first film. While Nyqvist still feels like a non-presence, at least this time, he is still the ineffectual “male lead” relegated to a supporting role in the events of the film. The cast and the world of the film are blown out which is good for the scope and revelations that aid to the story but the film feels hard-pressed to keep up and the entire enterprise feels pushed to the seams. Like the other stories in the series, there is still a large concentration on sex crimes and violence towards women that almost bordered on an obsession with Larsson. Because of that obsession, Larsson created one of the strongest female characters in modern fiction that rose from the ashes of brutal violence. The Girl Who Played with Fire sheds light on the character’s dark past but the lack of focus makes her more of an enigma than she really should be. It’s only through the brave performance by Rapace that the character leaves any presence at all and had the film shed its weight in light, poorly drawn supporting characters and one too many plot strands, the film could have worked better as a character study and not the broad, catch-all mystery that the film becomes.",1313

4135,"Third, like Thatcher (see previous post), Carter places heavy emphasis on less prominent features of the narrative in order to draw out a political reading while paying insufficient attention to the wider Jewish context of the narrative. This raises a much larger hermeneutical question: Should we pay attention primarily (or only) to the subtleties of a given text while glossing over repeated literary and theological motifs? Perhaps I am opening myself up to the charge of being an unsophisticated reader of the narrative, but my answer to that question is, “surely not.” Subtexts are an important means of textual communication and they should not be overlooked. However, neither should we abandon clear points of emphasis for elements that, frankly, may not even be present in the text. Warren Carter has been one of the leading figures in moving New Testament research into the field of empire studies. In particular, his work on Matthew has been influential for showing that Gospel’s interest in Roman issues. However, as is the case with anyone doing research in the related fields of Biblical and early Christian studies, there is a strong temptation to see our own interests in the texts we examine. Because of his research interests, Carter is conditioned to look for Roman images and themes, and in some of his other published works he has proven particularly adept at it. It seems to me that in the case of John’s Gospel—at least it relates to his main thesis—Carter has found what he was looking for rather than what is actually in (or behind) the text.",1567

In the 1930s a belief in homeopathy, which, when all its bogus scientific claims are stripped away, is simply the administration of a placebo, was as good a faith as any for my mother to adopt. There is nothing wrong with placebos, especially when the placebo effect flows from the care and attention of a sympathetic homeopathic practitioner as well as from a credulous patient hungry for a remedy to their illness. So we shouldn't pass too harsh a judgment on past medical practices seen through the lens of today.

Also, we relate to basic human needs: food, shelter, compassion, dignity, love. Amidst the spectacle that is the blood-thirsty games and the menacing control of the Capitol, Peeta Mellark is the first character to bring true emotion to this novel. His declaration of love for Katniss is shockingly sweet. And, that’s when it hits me that I’m reading young adult fiction. Enter adolescent angst about love and relationships juxtaposed with war, death, murder, cruelty and the media. Is there a more fitting image for what today’s teens have to face?",693

Jorge Sampaoli, very much a disciple of fellow Argentinean Marcelo Bielsa had La U playing a style of game that Rupert Fryer described as high-pressing, high-tempo, high-energy and high-pretty-much-everything. Their style of play was joy to watch scoring goals a-plenty but also were miserly in defence only conceding two in the successful Copa Sudamericana campaign. Already touted as a possible replacement for Claudio Borghi, Sampaoli wasn’t afraid to mix it up tactically and in this aspect in our eyes is superior to both the current and former managers of the national team. The only thing questionable about Sampaoli is his sense of fashion (see above).",819

My mother was on the kitchen phone with the emergency operator reporting that Brooks had threatened their lives when Christine was first shot.

Brooks’ determined discriminatory attitude has troubled me ever since. How did he become so certain about his decision to murder my mother and Christine? After the deaths, I watched in astonishment as the actual motivation for the crime was determined to be a property dispute instead of a hate crime.

Wellman’s film adaptation does feature a dog – a beautiful and talented St Bernard – but the animal story is very much in second place to that of the human characters, with a romance between Clark Gable and Loretta Young dominating the drama.

Test the dough by pulling at it; it should stretch a bit and have a little give. If it seems wet and loose and more like a batter than a dough, add a few tablespoons of flour and mix until it comes together. If it breaks off into pieces when you pull at it, continue to mix on medium speed for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until it develops more strength and stretches when you grab it.

I can't help but feel a little fatigued by the hit man framing, a device that seems dragged out of a dozen Tarantino rip-offs from the late 90's. But McDonagh is wise to forgo the sense of dirty glamour that most of those films purported about gangsterism, and instead sticks his pair of down-and-outs in Bruges, Belgium, to meditate on what they've done. Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) couldn't be an unlikelier couple - Ray is all brash upstart, forever wanting to go down to the pub rather than wait around for a call from their employer (a hilarious and terrifying Ralph Fiennes), while Ken is genuinely moved by the Medieval architecture and dreamlike provincialism of Bruges.

Further, if you jump forward ten years, these risk reduction schemes may well lead to further consolidation in the supplier base so it may be even harder for an OEM to credibly threaten to walk away from a supplier.",609

But what I want to get Adrian to do, when I talk to him about his novel, is to understand what he is writing and how it works or could work. So I ask him questions like 'who is the narrator?'

We had quite a big yard then, and it was great fun to pick out new plants to try together. As fate would have it, when I was putting yesterday's choices in the trunk, a young mom and her son pulled up, and began their search for the perfect wagon to pull down the rows. Every wagon her son tried was too big, so I hurried up so I could offer the one I had used -- a red Radio Flier, just the right size for small boys to pull.

What we want to do here is identify what type of tactics certain groups within our AO normally employ. Things like drive by shootings, or kidnappings, firebombings, or using IEDs. Something you’ll notice is as the threat becomes more sophisticated in its capabilities it’s tactics also follow suit. A run of the mill violent street gang may not employ fire and maneuver however a group of cartel Narcos Soldados most surely will. It’s interesting to note that even as a threat becomes more sophisticated and develops a sound tactical operational art they may not necessarily drop lower tech tactics. Those same narco cartels still conduct drive by shootings. A good technique to flesh this kind of info out is to do some good old fashioned research and “Waffle House” intel gathering. Pay particular attention to events like carjackings, drive by shootings, home invasions, arsons, increases in random sporadic violence (especially directed against authorities), large drug busts – including meth labs, etc.",1197

Praise the Lord! We had dreaded those 14.5 hours more than anything else over the 2 wk trip and it ended up being a breeze! We arrived safely in Chicago with the newest American! She was such a happy and chipper little thing as we waited on our luggage. We went through customs quickly and even had a chance to change Brielle's clothes before boarding the flight to Indy. As we boarded that plane, the man sitting behind us saw us coming with a baby and said, """"Oh, this will be fun. Good thing I brought ear plugs!"""" I tried to reassure him that she's a good traveler. Sure enough, she fell asleep before we ever took off and I had to wake her up after we got off the plane!

The tone is set further with perfectly coordinating attire for the bridal party; a haute couture – yet totally affordable – wedding gown that’s stunning on both a runway and in an outdoor wedding; glitzy accessories; a birch “bark” wedding cake; and lavish, fall fabulous decorations which can include rented birch trees (if the budget allows, of course). For the reception, bring the fall theme to the table with seasonally-inspired edibles such as a blood orange salad and an apple-based signature cocktail and end the evening with maple syrup favors for your guests!",837

Out of the three main actors it’s Keira Knightley that really steals the show as Sabina Spielrein, the woman that caused the fracture between Jung and Freud. I can see many actresses just over playing the role as the role does lend itself to the insanity. Yet while she does have her wild moments there are touches of the subtle woven throughout. Looking back on how she played some of the scenes, there is such a genius in every movement. Fassbender as Carl Jung is also excellent as the young psychologist trying to flesh out his ideas and most importantly figure out the best way to help people. Viggo Mortensen as Sigmun Freud rounds out the awesome trio. I think he’s the weakest of the three but only because he’s not given as much time to develop as a character. Still Viggo grabs onto the role and throttles as much as he can out of it.",882

If it is not in my power to oppress, hurt others, or attack; if I am too weak or inferior for these acts, then I am casting myself as good for not doing what I couldn’t do anyway.

He was in a state of almost constant warfare with his own colleagues at the museum, and his various advances in the hierarchy were vigorously resisted – a good starting point was usually his foreignness, though in fact he became a naturalised Briton in 1832 (which caused a breach with his fellow exile Mazzini). Interestingly, a number of the Museum’s staff since its foundation had been foreigners, including the Dutch Mathieu Maty, the Swiss Joseph Planta, the German Carl König, and the Swedish Daniel Solander (Banks’s friend, colleague and librarian), and none of these had chosen naturalisation. These precedents did not of course prevent meetings at which speakers expressed concern that Panizzi had been seen selling white mice on the streets of London; Fagan acidly notes that ‘had it been a few years later, possibly the distinctive title of organ-grinder would have been added’.",1305

The fact that Mirrorwriting really does manage to blur so many different musical worlds into something so smoothly unified is Woon's real achievement. But because of that very in-betweenness, Mirrorwriting is still likely to rankle genre partisans of all stripes. Too slick and synth-heavy and modern for fans of Winehouse-style retro-soul. Too subtle for true dubstep fans wanting more club thunder. Not subtle enough for those heart-on-sleeve beat weirdos who've made James Blake a cause celeb. So it'll be interesting to see if it really is the wide mass of pop and indie listeners that winds up embracing Woon's everything-at-once approach.

5178,"One of our interns chose to study mental wellness / mental illness. Her presentation Sunday debunked some myths and misconceptions about mental illness. There is a significant connection between homelessness (a very important topic at Flatlanders!) and mental illness. Yesterday’s presentation connected some of the dots between the two topics, especially through a really helpful comparison story. We heard about two individuals, one with a physical illness (diabetes) and another with a mental illness (schizophrenia). The individual with diabetes was supported by health care providers and friends, was not stigmatized, and found ways to remain in her home, office, and social circle even when frequent ‘episodes’ of diabetes were debilitating. The individual with schizophrenia was stigmatized, ostracized, institutionalized and prevented from doing many of the things that were most helpful; even though his ‘episodes’ were less frequent and less debilitating than those of the individual with diabetes. He could easily end up homeless and without support – which is the story of some of our neighborhood friends at Flatlanders. Something great about a this intern and her topic is that she was able to do first-hand research (in the form of genuine friendships with folks from the neighborhood) as well as book research. She spent a lot of intentional time developing relationships with people who have been marginalized by a society that has no room for them and doesn’t really want to understand them. She shared a painting done by one of our neighborhood friends (who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia), and it was a poignant expression of how difficult his life can be. After seeing his painting and learning a little more about his illness, I know I will treasure him and his contribution to Flatlanders even more. He joins us frequently for meals, and we all appreciate him. The whole presentation was enriching and helpful for our whole community!",1964

I can't help but admire and love Herzog's willingness to heedlessly plummet into the void of insanity alongside any character who happens to be going that way, rather than hanging around on the precipice making excuses like Barbet Schroeder, even if the result is sometimes the same.

5329,"A clinical psychologist, Ellen Weber Libby, PhD, has written The Favorite Child ($18.00, Prometheus Books, softcover) based on thirty years of helping successful, often powerful clients in Washington, D.C., where outsized personalities abound. Based on more than 60,000 hours of therapeutic counseling her book looks at the advantages and disadvantages of being the favorite child. Having been brought up to believe they can do anything, being unafraid of challenges, they often suffer an array of personality problems from the pressure to maintain the façade at all costs. Their ability to tell the truth can suffer and their intimate relationships are often elusive. We have seen this over and over again when politicians are brought down by adulterous affairs and other bad behavior. I found this book provided powerful insights and, if you think you were a favorite child or a member of your family was one, you might well want to read this interesting book. From the same publisher there’s God’s Brain by Lionel Tiger and Michael McGuire ($25.00, Prometheus Books) that takes part in the fractious debate about the existence of God and the nature of religion. What makes this book particularly interesting is that the authors approach the topic based on evolutionary biology with a focus on brain science. Tiger is a famed anthropologist and McGuire is a pioneering neuroscientist. The thesis they put forth is that the brain creates religion and its varied concepts of God and then, in turns, feeds on its creation to satisfy innate neurological and associated social needs. Not exactly the story you got from the Old and New Testament or other sacred text, but surely a fascinating exploration of how religion helps “soothe” the mind in a stressful world. One can see this at work when people with strong religious beliefs are able to cope with tragedy in a fashion that reduces the initial shock and guides them to a successful response.",1945

But at the same time, I think Garfinkel and Ganor may be reading too much into these artefacts. To say that these boxes are miniatures of the Ark of God is a claim that can only be made with reference to the descriptions of the Ark in biblical literature. This raises a methodological issue as to whether they are letting the biblical text colour their thinking of ordinary artefacts. But besides that, the boxes don’t seem to resemble the descriptions of the Ark very closely.",730

5414,"The question naturally presents itself—why did St. Gregory choose April 25 for a procession and Station in which everything reminds us of compunction and penance, and which would seem so out of keeping with the joyous season of Easter? The first to give a satisfactory answer to this difficulty was Canon Moretti, a learned liturgiologist of the eighteenth century. In a dissertation of great erudition, he proves that in the fifth, and probably even in the fourth, century, April 25 was observed at Rome as a day of great solemnity. The faithful went, on that day, to the Basilica of St. Peter, in order to celebrate the anniversary of the first entrance of the Prince of the Apostles into Rome, upon which he thus conferred the inalienable privilege of being the capital of Christendom. It is from that day that we count the twenty-five years, two months, and some days that St. Peter reigned as Bishop of Rome. The Sacramentary of St. Leo gives us the Mass of this solemnity, which afterwards ceased to be kept. St. Gregory, to whom we are mainly indebted for the arrangement of the Roman Liturgy, was anxious to perpetuate the memory of a day which gave to Rome her grandest glory. He therefore ordained that the Church of St. Peter should be the Station on that auspicious day. April 25 comes too frequently during the octave of Easter that it could not be kept as a feast, properly so called, in honour of St. Peter’s entrance into Rome; St. Gregory, therefore, adopted the only means left of commemorating the great event.",1529

Three violins; two stand on little platforms and one on the floor, a little further from the horn. The fourth person at the middle of the central group and closest to the horn is probably the singer, although he could be holding, but not playing, a flute. Dominating the image, on the right, is Roberto Firpo at the piano, his left arm a strong diagonal into the central group of musicians. He's the leader, but I assume he's higher than the other musicians because the sound balance requires it, the back of the piano to the horn.

I don’t think I’ve had a Macaroni and cheese casserole in years. I can’t remember the details now but I do remember that they made plenty of sense. I will be cooking one for lunch today (grin). I didn’t have any fear, while this event was taking place last night. It was just a state of discomfort, with me faced off against and confronting an unknown force. It is the same kind of thing as when we are focused on using force and concentration to accomplish a complicated and technical effort. There’s a deep assurance I have in the agencies that protect me; from myself and other things external. They tend to get me thru everything, even if the ride can be a little bumpy. Enough of that. I put this out only because I am hearing from many people about similar things. This morning I received an email from a friend who was concerned about me and who wanted me to send him a ‘smoke signal’ because he was worried about me, based on something he must have been feeling. Odd, that. Like I said, enough about all that for the moment. Let’s look at what’s going on in the world around us.",1258

I liked that idea, so I started my first internet company in 1998 and was able to raise several millions of dollars in VC money within the first 3 months. I will tell you more about that venture some other day. Fast forward to 2008, I had dinner with a friend and fraternity brother. He had bought the name eRollover.com some time ago and was sitting on the name trying to come up with a good business model to use the name. During dinner that evening, I had asked him what he did with eRollover.com, because I had some ideas around starting a company in the financial services sector. He said, he was not using the name, so that evening; I hatched the idea to start eRollover.com. I wrote a quick 1 pager as to what eRollover was to be and how it would make money. The next morning I had breakfast with my friend and new business partner. I proposed a partnership deal. Finding a business partner you trust and can work well with is one of the hardest parts to starting a company. I had struck gold because Mike was all of that plus more. He would not let anything slip; he always put 150% in to any project. We used the eRollover name and put the business plan I had written into action. We split responsibilities and started executing. My whole plan was to build a great company with rich content, great features and an A grade management team. I knew I wanted to raise VC money, but wanted to prove the business model first.",1673

The Vedas are the spine of Hindu tradition and should be respected as such even though many Hindus don’t carry their lessons in the forefront of their minds every day. But visit any Hindu home and you’ll feel the serenity and be the benefactor of their dedication to ahimsa. While not all Hindus are strict vegetarians, the conscientious guest or host will err on the side of caution and not bring any animal based cuisine. If a guest in a Hindu home commits a faux pas, it will probably not be brought to anyone’s attention because to a Hindu, the guest is God. Everyone has the Divine in them and is deserving of service and respect. A simple by–product of ahimsa respect. As one Hindu commits to nonviolence, many he has relationships with follow suit so they do not offend him, their friend who is also divine. The world could learn a lot from Hindus.",922

Now I just had to deal with the Squad attacking the survivors of my 2nd Crusader squad. The only way to do this was to get into combat, and the only squad who could was the 3rd and final Crusader squad. I had no choice so I had to gamble, they charged in and the dice went my way; all the Wolf Scouts died leaving only the Wolf Guard, who fluffed his power fist attacks and then broke from combat.

5955,"Other segments are diverting, with minor pleasures but nothing more substantial. The Coen brothers' decision to base their Tuileries around the face of Steve Buscemi is a brilliant comic choice, as the actor broadly mimes his reactions to a passionate French couple who include him in their tumultuous, violent way of teasing each other. Buscemi's bug-eyed mugging is always a pleasure to watch, and the Coens structure the sequence around his silent incomprehension of French, keeping the American actor silent while the French couple yells and chatters at him. The broad comedy of it works, and the aesthetics suggest that Buscemi's character is a silent movie hero in a sound world, telegraphing his confusion and frustration entirely through the expressions on his malleable face. Alfonso Cuarón offers up an even more rarefied pleasure: the gritty joy of hearing Nick Nolte speak. The actor's raspy drone is the real star of Cuarón's basic little short, which consists almost entirely of a tracking shot along a street as Nolte's character has a conversation with a younger woman (Ludivine Sagnier). Cuarón keeps the camera at such a distance, tracking along on the opposite side of the street from the actors, that the aural component has to drive the short, and Nolte's distinctive voice would make it obvious that it was him even if he wasn't onscreen at all. The short's conceit is too cutesy by far, keeping the relationship between the two people ambiguous through vague dialogue, and the lame little """"twist"""" at the end is eye-roll-inducing, but Nolte and Sagnier's largely verbal and enjoyable performances prevent it from being a total loss.",1654

I was trying to figure out a way to protect them from the strong northerly winds. I toyed with cloches, netting, fleece, with no joy, until Dave had the brilliant idea of making a barrier around that section of the plot by extending some windbreak netting out from the fence. We drove a stake into the ground as with the perimeter fencing and used wire and staples to attach the netting. Not only does it protect my fragile plants, it breaks the plot up and gives it a bit more structure. I extended the flower bed around it too.

First, my son and I visited St. Johnsbury, Vermont twice over a total period of three weeks. We were able to find literally thousands of relevant records, manuscripts, books, sermons, teachings, newspapers articles, and other writings that showed the immense Christian upbringing Dr. Bob had as a youngster in Vermont. His upbringing involved the Great Awakening of 1875 which preceded his birth but impacted on the entire community of St. Johnsbury. It involved his Congregationalist parents and their indoctrination of Bob with facts about salvation and the Word of God. It involved the North Congregational Church of St. Johnsbury, Vermont where the entire Smith family attended church services at least 4 times each week. The father was a Deacon, a member of the Executive Committee, and a Sunday school teacher. The mother helped write a history of the church, headed its Christian education program, sang in the choir, and was active in many church activities.

6068,"In the 1960's, the CIA contacted Johnny Roselli, Sam Giancana and Salvatore Trafficante to help them assassinate Castro. Why the Mafia? Well Castro's rise to power had destroyed the Mafia's hold on the Casino's which they had controlled during the previous regime. They had lost millions of dollars when the Casino's were confiscated when Castro took over. Also, most of them still had contacts with disgruntled anti-Castro associates who would be happy to help them with the job. The CIA offered Giancana and Roselli a $100,000 to do the job, which they refused, happy to do it for free. Unfortunately, the Three Stooges could have done a better job. Despite the resources of both the Mafia and the CIA, they were never able to get the job done, despite repeated attempts. Everything was tried from poisoning his food to his cigars. In the meantime, Giancana used the services of the CIA, to have comedian Dan Rowan's dressing room and hotel bugged in Las Vegas to see if Rowan was having an affair with his girlfriend, singer Phyllis McGuire. The man sent to the job ended up arrested which almost blew the whole operation sky high. The revelations of the CIA plot to kill Castro was revealed in the 'Family Jewel' papers that were released. Roselli had actually tried to use the information to keep from being deported but the CIA didn't care. The attempts continued while Johnson was President. The question still remains whether JFK or RFK knew of the plot.",1462

During the period from the Second World War until the 1970′s, we were becoming a more equal society and the lot of the average worker was improving. However, since the late 1970′s, inequality in the UK and US has been rising astronomically. In real terms, the income of the average person has not risen at all in 40 years, yet the real income of the richest has risen astronomically in that time. Similarly, wealth inequality has increased dramatically, with the proportion of wealth owned by the top 1% increasing from 17% to 23% since 1980. The means the average person has seen no increase in their spending power and they are losing their access to wealth generating assets.

A girl who has always loved George Valentin (that is the name of protagonist: any resemblance to real persons like Rodolfo Valentino is not purely coincidental), when she was an adoring spectator of his films, and now, after having saved George from ruin, will help him to enter in the new cinema.

6215,"That clip of Laurence Guittard accompanied by Donna McKechnie as well as Michael Gruber and Danette Holden, the actors playing the young versions of their characters Ben Stone and Sally Durant, and Billy Hartung as the young Buddy Plummer, comes from the great 1998 production of Stephen Sondheim's Follies by the Paper Mill Playhouse of Millburn, N.J. Follies premiered on Broadway 40 years ago today, the second in Sondheim's incredible run of musicals directed by Harold Prince in the 1970s. It followed their groundbreaking musical Company the year before which earned 14 Tony nominations and won six, including best musical. A big difference with Follies was that its famed choreographer Michael Bennett was credited alongside Prince as co-director. I was fortunate enough to see the Paper Mill production of Follies, living in Parsippany, N.J., at the time. What a heady cast it had. In addition to Guittard (who earned a Tony nomination as Count Malcolm in the original Broadway production of Sondheim's A Little Night Music) and McKechnie (the original Cassie in A Chorus Line), the cast included Dee Hoty, Tony Roberts, Eddie Bracken, Ann Miller, Kaye Ballard, Phyllis Newman and Liliane Montevecchi. I'd never seen a Follies production before that, but it already was one of my favorite Sondheim scores, despite the fact the cast recording of the 1971 original is widely considered one of the all-time botch jobs. It's so incredible that many numbers were cut during the process of putting the show together so Paper Mill did a great service by doing a cast recording that not only included the show's songs but recordings by the cast of the many cut numbers, making it the most complete recording ever. It's a treasure, but then almost every song from Follies is a gem even if, as is often the problem with many musicals, especially Sondheim's, the book by James Goldman doesn't meet the same level of excellence as the brilliant compositions. As our intrepid Senior New York Theater Correspondent Josh R said, """"On rare occasions — and I think that they are more rare than many are given to suppose — a book doesn’t make or break a show, and the score of Follies is so rich, varied and gorgeous to listen to that it can probably absorb whatever deficiencies the show has as a whole. Certainly, Follies’ flaws haven’t prevented it from enjoying an extended life beyond its initial production; the show is always seemingly going up somewhere, and audiences are always happy to greet its return."""" How true Josh's words are, and that's why I salute the 40th anniversary of Follies' Broadway opening.",2606

6377,"A recent concert appearance in Santa Fe by Fusion pioneer John McLaughlin has reopened this long running debate on the merits of this style of music. He is the pre-eminent Fusion musician on the planet, still releasing new cds and touring all over the world at sixty-eight years of age. He has played the guitar for the last sixty years and has been at the forefront of this highly technical brand of music since its creation in the late 1960’s. No one that has ever seen or heard John McLaughlin play would doubt that he has a tremendous command of the guitar. Not only does he play at times with a blazing pace on the fret board, but he is also a master improviser in the great Jazz tradition. What has made McLaughlin such an imposing figure is that he does have more than just technical virtuosity plugged into his amp. There is a lyricism to the guitar lines that he endlessly weaves, and he has also proven himself to be one of the original innovators in creating a true World Music style. He has played with both Miles Davis and Jimi Hendrix, and that high octane mixture of jazz and rock is what Fusion is all about. His 70’s electric band Mahavishnu Orchestra had some of the best musicians around (Cobham, Goodman, and Hammer), while he later created Shakti as a vehicle to explore his interest in Indian music. Guitarists Jeff Beck and Pat Metheny have both called John the best guitarist in the world, lofty praise from two highly respected musicians. His performance with The Fourth Dimension band was a microcosm of all things good and bad that have been debated about Fusion since its creation. Excessive soloing might be a downer for some, but how do you argue with such mind blowing technical virtuosity? Others might cry about a lack of “songs” (a la Burt Bacharach), but these four musicians exhibited a cohesion rarely seen that trumped any mundane need for familiar tunes. If someone said it sounded like a guitar / drum clinic at times I wouldn’t argue, but what a sound they threw at us! Etienne M’bappe was a revelation with his unique bass lines, while Mark Mondesir kept the drum seat red hot all night long. Keyboardist Gary Husband added a lot of tasteful licks with McLaughlin the whole evening smiling as if he had finally found that lost chord he’d been searching for all these years. John called himself just an aging hippie at one point during the concert, and that humility rang as true as any note from his guitar. Like a Zen master patiently waiting for his future students to find him, McLaughlin has explored the fret board in a variety of styles throughout his life, and has stayed open to its possibilities. Many people aspire to be the best at what they do, but hard work and skill will only get you so far. After many years he came to the realization that a true master doesn’t just play the guitar, you also have to let the guitar play you.",2883

It’s a fantastic scene, and her delivery of the line “no more orders” makes it. It’s the Problem of Susan solved - the companion who finally grows from girl sidekick to an equal who stares down the Doctor and makes him blink. In this exchange Romana upends the entire structure and logic of the show, confidently stealing the starring role out from under the Doctor. But the result is that we want to follow her, not the Doctor. She should be the protagonist, and her adventures in E-Space sound a damn sight more exciting than Tom Baker wandering around with that whiny prat in the yellow pajamas.",774

John Locke elaborated a system of various “properties.” There were primary properties, the essential physical properties of the object; secondary properties, the causal properties of the object such that it caused the mental representation to be as it was; and tertiary properties, the properties of the representation (Locke would say “impression”). In other words a fairly messy tangle. Berkeley, whose views appear strange when presented out of context, made what was in fact a common-sense (and thoroughly empiricist) suggestion: if the mental representation (the “idea”) is the only thing that we, in actual fact, experience, and there is an intractable problem about the relationship between the idea and the “material world,” why don’t we cut the Gordian knot by simply saying that ideas are constitutive of the world, and be done with the problematic “matter” altogether? After all we can only know about the ideas. So let’s just call our ontology “idealism” and move on. Chalmers’ move is very similar: embrace mind-body dualism so that we can forget about it.",1119

6443,"Just as we may find things about ourselves in self-reflection, self-examination, and self-observation that are upsetting, unexpected, or even negative, so too is it very likely that we will find things about beings external to ourselves–whether those beings are humans or deities–that are challenging, difficult, trying, exasperating, and even wholly objectionable. However, coming into contact with such difficulties is not a bad thing in itself; indeed, such challenges are the only thing that allows us to grow and change. We do have control over how we grow and change as a result of coming into contact with those difficulties–we can choose to move toward a greater integration, towards productivity and positivity, towards compassion and forgiveness, understanding and love for those things that are different or even abhorrent, or we can choose to move toward disintegration, negativity, and resentment towards those things which are different, and to forego any attempts at understanding or empathy with them. (I think you can guess which one I’d personally advocate as the better choice in almost every case!) It’s one of the dangers and splendors of dealing with other people, whether those people are humans or deities. I think of it in terms of chemistry, really. Water can sit and contemplate itself all the livelong day, but at the end of the day, it will still be water, with a bit of hydroxide (HO-) and a bit of hydronium (H3O+) mixed in there with the good old H2O for good measure. But, it only can really change when it comes into contact with external agents, and those chemical shifts and chemical reactions only occur when those types of contacts exist; whether the water simply changes color, or whether it becomes acidic, varies from situation to situation–even the most caustic acids have their uses when certain substances need to be dissolved!

I completed it faster than my previous 5Ks, but I didn’t reach my goal of running the entire thing. Then it was time to train for my next race. See Jane Run 1/2 Marathon was in June. Realizing that I was not going to be able to run that entire race, I decided I needed a training plan. That is where I ran into the 4 run 2 minute walk training plan. I loved it. As a matter of fact, I have loved it so much, it has almost become a crutch. I began to feel like I would never be able to run more than 4 minutes at a time. So in the last year, I have tested myself several times to prove to myself I can run a full mile. I can run more than 4 minutes. I can do this. I can do that. But I have YET to run a full 5K distance without stopping!",1315

Since Raimi’s last turn with the webbed-slinger, the atrocious Spider-Man 3, left a bad taste in fans’ mouths, it’s anyone’s guess as to how the new reboot plays, but with stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone leading a supporting cast that includes Dennis Leary, Sally Field, Rhys Ifans, and Martin Sheen, Amazing Spider-Man definitely has the potential to restore audiences’ love for the red and blue web slinger.",882

6830,The very first time I tried to dye something was around 1980 and I was living in Hoboken. I got some turquoise procion dye in a little packet from Pearl Paint in Manhattan. It came with it’s own little bit of soda ash. It all seemed so complicated. I wanted to try batik. I melted some beeswax and painted this giant sheet. I think I painted a huge unicorn or something on it. Anyway I filled a small garbage can with dye and soda ash and water and put the sheet in. Then I left it there for like six weeks. I just didn’t know what to do with it. Everyday I would walk by it in the kitchen and have that same anxious feeling I just told you about. So one day I started to wring it out in the bathtub and turquoise was everywhere. Oh my god I was making a huge mess! I got a big old black garbage bag and threw the whole thing out.

As of January 2011, a woman must receive state-directed counseling that includes information that is designed to discourage her from having an abortion. This information must be provided in person at the clinic 24 hours before a woman is allowed to obtain the procedure. The pamphlets and packets that is provided include diagrams of what the fetus looks like at its various stages and describes in detail the various organ functions developing at different states. Before the woman is provided with these detailed handouts, she is required to watch the ultra sound of the fetus as the doctor describes it in detail. The doctor is then required to look for a heartbeat in the fetus and play it for the woman, if it is found.

6973,"As someone who was the caregiver for two aging parents, both of whom lived into their nineties, I found Feeding Mrs. Moskowitz and the The Caregiver: Two Stories by Barbara Pokras and Fran Pokras Yariv ($19.95, Syracuse University Press, softcover) a delightful experience. It is a candid and humorous look at aging. With 4.3 million Americans now taking on the role of caregivers to loved ones, there are plenty of stories to tell and share. The book is two novellas in which we meet Golde Moskowitz, an elderly Russian-born widow living alone with her memories and, in the second we visit a fictional upscale assisted-living facility in Hollywood and learn about it through the eyes of Ofelia Hernandez, a young Latina caregiver who relates the lives of those living there. It is well worth reading whether one is a caregiver or not, aging or not. This is a slice of life worth visiting. A Sacred Walk: Dispelling the Fear of Death and Caring for the Dying($15.95, A&A Publishing, softcover) by Donna M. Authers addresses the fact that all of us will die at some point and that all of us will be called upon to help a parent, spouse, friend or other loved one make the final journey. Helping them make the most of their last years, months or weeks can provide priceless memories, despite the fact that it will test you in every way. This is Authers’ personal story, but it is also ultimately everyone’s story when faced with this final stage of life.",1452

Christian marriage (or Jewish marriage, or whatever faith marriage) should be its own institution, completely free from any sort of state sanctioning, or recognition. Civil marriage would be the only state-sanctioned domestic union. Want a religious marriage? Fine, get one; however, if you want it recognized outside of your church or the community of faith, then you need the civil marriage as well. The government would recognize religious marriages that meet the same criteria as the civil marriage if they apply for it. Government wouldn't tell churches to recognize their marriages, churches couldn't tell government to recognize their marriages.

I sat in the truck waiting, waiting and finally stomped into the generator garage to remind my husband that I was alive. He was talking to the technician. Surprise. I was standing, tapping my toes loudly when I noticed a jar on the counter FULL of Fireballs ~ one of my favorite candies which I have not had the pleasure of sucking on in a long time! I walked right over to the counter, stuck my hand in and pulled one out. I wanted to pop it in my mouth right then but what if it was one of the wicked hot ones and I couldn't hold it in my mouth until the hotness dissolved? I didn't want this technician to see me as a wimp. So I shoved it in my coat pocket for later. Minutes go by, generator talk still droning on so to the counter I go and grab another Fireball, giggling as I pull my hand out. I looked for a sign that said 'one per customer' but none was anywhere to be seen so now two Fireballs sat in my pocket. I walked around the generator showroom trying to figure out what in the world two grown men could find so interesting about this piece of metal when the urge came over me to grab just one more Fireball. Now I am feeling a little bit naughty at this point. I know I shouldn't grab the third Fireball but I did. It was done rather sneakily but I did notice the technician watching me. Oops. Time for me to go sit in the truck. So off I went ... three brilliant red Fireballs in my pocket... which I am saving for the perfect moment when I can just sit back, eyes closed, enjoying each molecule of hotness.

My disgust for Penn State is borderline hate (but my grandmother taught me when I was little to never hate anyone. I bet your nana taught you that too). I think there’s some kind of brainwashing that goes on at freshman orientation, kind of like in the movie “Disturbing Behavior.” I’m kidding of course. Or am I? At the same time that I don’t get it, I do. Penn State is Joe Paterno and football. They go together like bread and butter. He’s been around for almost half of the schools existence (not really, but close) and he’s turned the institution into a huge place, just because of football. To Staters, Joe Pa and football are the be all end all. They can do anything and it’s okay because the football program makes the school a ton of money, wins, and brings national recognition that PSU is a “cool” place to go. I use cool in quotes because have any of you been to State College? It’s not that cool. Without PSU, State College is just another sleepy town in Pennsyltucky. Tucked along 322 and 80. Students, alumni and fan boys hold Paterno and the whole football program to this inappropriately high standard. They’re god-like and all the little blue and white sheeple have this massive ego like they’re allowed to be these snobby, elitist kids because PSU is the most awesome thing ever (You’d think they went to Yale or something). Side note: at the trustee presser, I wanted to punch the student reporters and students in general in the face. The media didn’t bring this problem to Sad Valley. The offenders/cover uppers did. Okay, moving on…Then you go outside of the State College/central PA bubble people aren’t as in your face about their love for Penn State. It’s literally like a cult, but in this cult they’re all amped up on school spirit and are ready to roid rage at any second. I love my alma matter a lot, but it doesn’t mean I need to act like an asshole about it all the time. Didn’t anyone ever hear about false idols? How about the cult of personality?

I think I can figure out for myself that if the prep time is 10 minutes, it’s quick, and that roasted cauliflower is vegetarian. Paltrow also disappoints when she suggests how to “make it vegan” for many meals. Leaving out cheese, or replacing chicken with vegetables, may make a meal free of animal products, but where is the vegetarian protein?

7268,"I can’t really say I cared for any of the performances in this movie either. The first thing that started getting on my nerves was that they were supposed to be in France, and every character was supposed to be French, but all they could really muster was one word a piece in French. Once every 20 minutes or so, a character would say something like, “That is terrible!” but with terrible being pronounced as it would be in French, like teh-ree-blay. I don’t need them to speak a lot in French, but you can also not bother having them speak French at all. And you can just have the movie not be set in France because they never really left the house of the scientist anyway. Patricia Owens had to do most of the carrying of this movie, but never really seemed that up to the task. I suppose it wasn’t really her fault, but she didn’t impress. This movie made me realize that every actress had the exact same crying technique. To cry, you need only to drape yourself sideways over something like a desk or a bannister, bury your face in crook of your arm, and make weeping noises. Every girl does this exact thing when crying in these old movies. And Owens does it around three times in this movie alone. Also, as this movie is kind of a horror movie, you know that she’ll have to scream. Her scream sounded really weird, and probably a few octaves deeper than it should have. She also annoyed me when she grabbed the fly net away from her son to try to catch the fly because he had already caught half a jar full of flies and she was unable to catch one. Maybe you should leave it to the pro, honey. This is going to sound weird, but I actually liked the way David Hedison acted when he was the fly, even though he couldn’t speak or even show his face. He didn’t do anything impressive when he had his face, so they covered it up with a blanket and said that it looked like fly under there. But they worked out a method of communication for him involving typing, writing on a chalkboard, and knocking on a desk for yes and no. But his body language was well-executed so that he could still act even without the use of his face. Even Vincent Price didn’t impress me in this movie. I don’t think this is the type of movie that he really shined in. It’s kind of a horror movie, but he wasn’t trying to be spooky in it. From what I’ve gathered about him, that’s what he’s best at. In this one, he just had to be really concerned and mopey all the time, and it didn’t really work for me.",2482

7419,"The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening represented a surprising amount of firsts for the series back in 1993, when it was first released for the Game Boy. It was the first handheld Zelda game for starters, and was also the first game in the series not to feature Zelda herself, nor the Triforce, nor the setting of Hyrule. Though the game began development as an attempt to port The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past to the Game Boy (hah, as if that was possible…), it eventually became its own original story, a ‘gaiden chapter’ of sorts that instead became a follow-up/spin-off combo to A Link to the Past’s story, starring the same Link from that game on a new adventure after his successful defeat of archenemy, Ganon. Moving the series away from Hyrule, Link’s Awakening shifted the setting to Koholint Island, a mysterious place guarded by an entity called the Wind Fish, whom Link must awaken from a deep sleep to escape the place. I never noticed it as a kid, but LA has a bit of a… weird premise. Not only is the game objective literally to wake up a giant sleeping fish that is inside a big spotted egg (seriously), but you have to do so by going into the series’ usual helping of dungeons, and slaying the fish’s nightmare creatures to gain enchanted instruments that you must play at the egg to wake the fish up. I think it’s safe to say that this is one of the stranger Zelda games out there, but despite that, it’s still one of the best from both a gameplay and an innovation standpoint for the time. Not only did LA mark the series’ first successful translation to a handheld, but it also introduced several elements that would shape every subsequent installment in the series to date, including a fishing minigame, connecting each dungeon’s vital item to that dungeon’s boss fight (A Link to the Past did this once or twice, but it wasn’t always a mandatory element to bosses until this game), a trading sequence, and side quests that weren’t just looking for Pieces of Heart. LA was in fact so enjoyed and beloved, for good reason, that it was even re-released with a ‘DX Edition’ as a launch title for the Game Boy Color in 1998, which functioned simultaneously as both a re-release and an enhanced port. The cartridge could be played in an original Game Boy to completely replicate the original Game Boy release with no clear alterations, but if you put it in a Game Boy Color, you would unlock several bonus features, not the least of which was an entire bonus dungeon based around the theme of colours. Fittingly, LADX was also the first Game Boy Color game to be released on the 3DS Virtual Console, where players can enjoy it for the low, low price of $6. This was the first Game Boy Color game I ever owned, and only my second Zelda game, though my first ‘proper’ Zelda game, after my parents got me Zelda II on the NES to get my feet wet with (not the best starter game in the series, as I said in my review of that). This was a game I loved and replayed several times as a kid, and as an adult, I revisited it for Zeldafest, playing through it from start to finish again. I’m happy to report that this game is as amazing and enjoyable as ever, despite its strange storyline, which is kind of part of this game’s odd charm, really. Like A Link to the Past, this game is required playing for anyone that considers themselves a serious gamer, so if you happen to own a 3DS, you definitely need to make this a priority download off of the eShop, especially if you never got a chance to enjoy it on the Game Boy or the Game Boy Color back in the 90′s!",3573

7453,"Let’s return, then, to God’s Love, Power, and Fatherhood, and address some of the issues raised by their abstraction. As we do this we must keep in mind that because of the one-way ladder we can never work from human definitions upwards, but must always work from God’s self-revelation to us. We do not know what ‘Love’ truly is, except by gazing at God in Christ. And that means human love is an utterly insufficient platform from which to make determinations about God. From God’s perspective, however, the purest expression of His Love, revealed to us, is the Cross—a very different picture of love than what we would choose! But it is one that in its severity and costliness makes some sense of a doctrine of Hell. We do not know what ‘Power’ is except by looking at God in Christ, and what we see in him is a person who rejected earthly power in favor of Heavenly submission. Christ’s power meant submitting to the will of God, that is, to crucifixion. Once again, this is profoundly opposed to our human definition of power! Thus, the Power of God is revealed in the submission of Christ to the plan of God—that is, power revealed in self-limitation to the constraints of God’s character. In this way, the question of the stone-too-heavy-to-lift is brought into focus as an absurdity. It is based on an abstraction of power that is separated from God’s character—as if God could violate Himself! Lastly, we don’t know what Fatherhood is except by looking at the Son and the Father in relationship. And here we come to see that the Fatherhood of God sets the parameters for His mission to the world—to bring His beloved children home to Him. And thus God is the One “from whom all Fatherhood in heaven and on earth derives its name” (Eph 3:15). Our idea of ‘Father’ must be informed by God, and not the other way round.",1824

When you are choosing cosmetics such as foundation, for example, avoid drying cosmetics or cosmetics that cause your skin to break out. Unfortunately, you may have to try several products in order to determine those that work on your skin consistently. Another issue which must be considered is that your skin may build up a reaction to a particular cosmetic which did not previously cause a skin irritation, so you may be forced to find an alternative to a tried and true brand which worked well in the past.

Speaking ahead the high level meeting on Universal Access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support slated for New York, from 8-10 June, he told the gathering, organised by the Network of AIDS Services Organisation in The Gambia and funded by UNAIDS-The Gambia, that there were ongoing efforts and preparations at national, regional and global levels to draw attention to the high level meeting on Universal Access.",1209

It should be borne in mind that if an author opts out after publishing with Xlibris, then the cover work and all layout files remain with the publisher, meaning, should the author move to another POD publisher, they are effectively starting from scratch. This still remains the norm, and I personally believe it is something that must change with the leading POD publishers.

Syncretisms of various sorts are in development with Antinous, and with others in the Antinoan Pantheon (like Polydeukion, etc.), that are intra-pantheonic, inter-pantheonic, and entirely internal. The Serpent Path has been a practice and a theoretical model that is being used to understand and delve more deeply into syncretism in an Antinoan context.

Complicated diagrams and pages of meditation material interspersed within selections of actual prayers were put to rest. Instead his text was complete yet concise, as well as clear and understandable as a true liturgical work. Though the Baal haTanya did not include the meditating upon the form of the menorah, he did prescribe a reading of Psalm 67 and some interesting kavannot relating to it. What made these kavannot so meaningful that he felt compelled to include them?",772

Indeed, at times, Macpherson is like a believer whose faith, threatened by the very existence of non-believers, begins to doubt his belief in God and so resorts to endless repetitions of “God exists!” in an attempt to bolster his weakening faith. Macpherson’s response to DS Davidson’s reasonable interpretation typifies the hysteria that has accompanied the inquiry. According to Macpherson, DS Davidson’s refusal to accept that this crime was racist ‘may well have affected his approach to the case.’ (para, 19.44). To which one must add that Macpherson’s handling of the inquiry, especially his treatment of the police, has been markedly skewed by his uncritical acceptance that this was a racially-motivated murder.",1051

7826,"The cat that showed up yet again. On Thursday morning, she saw D and tore to my door, up the flight of steps and into my flat. And plonked herself down my side of the bed, promptly falling asleep. I miss my cats back home sorely (if you haven't seen my favourite one Ms K yet, you should!) and in Cambridge, the rare time I saw a cat wandering about the streets I was on Cloud Nine. I used to counsel and process adoptions at the local SPCA back home, so being deprived of having animals to touch and cuddle made me feel terrible-- worse than bad college food that makes you feel sickly and massively unsatisfied at the same time, whilst knowing it's gonna load you up with fats. My main mantra is, if I eat loads and grow tubbier, that's my business because I chose the food and I loved it; but the same effect with food I was forced to pay for and hate? No way! So, there were two black-and-white cats lurking about college grounds occasionally, owned by a resident nearby. Everytime I saw either I'd be excited and was convinced I would have good luck that day. I wished hard enough that Brighton would have loads of cats or that some cat would 'adopt' me, and I was far from disappointed. This cat dashed towards us as we left the flat for a drink on the first night, charging and purring by the light of the full moon. Another day when I was walking up the steps to my flat, I saw a cat outside my door. The main door and my flat door was shut. I thought it was a magic cat. And let her in. D said, """"She tore in when I answered the door and the delivery man came. She snooped about everywhere for too long so I let her out but she didn't want to leave the front door"""". Oh!",1677

For a winemaker, this had to be like getting your prostate examined by a guy you aren’t sure is a doctor.

Nobody seems to have convinced them that you cannot be both Leftist and nationalist.

However , if you are looking for a torrid, sexually erotic scene between two horny flyboys, you (gratefully) will not find it here. This scene is definitely sexy because of the circumstances—and the fact that we’ve been waiting for it for nearly two-thirds of the story—but in 1979 you didn’t write that sort of thing if you wanted to find a publisher—even an avant-garde one. Nevertheless, I think it is made a more realistic story because of it. This a story about men in love in war, and not about sex per se.",882

For instance, Evangelion had those last two episodes that made people go wtf?, yet a handful of individuals saw this as some sort of SYMBOLISM! People tend to let the storyline of GITS or LOTGH get the best of them, automatically making them geniuses who sit in class all day during lecture, doing pointless crap on the computer that no one cares about. If that is the case, then where the hell is the pretension in Redline? If the oh so perty animation is the “pretension” they are talking about, then I for one, am not buying it.",1228

Amber is a thoroughly America beer, but its lineage is much in keeping with the gentler session ales of the UK. On cask, the malt was smooth and creamy, a perfect base for the slightly sweet, fresh, fruity American hops. Some malts manage to communicate the quality of the fresh, lively springs that feed their distilleries. Cask Amber does, too.

Apparently that is a common misconception but that was the first time I had heard of it. As much as I have camped out in libraries and books stores, not once had I ever heard of someone reading only half of a book. That only shows you that there is something special about the Bible. There is life in the Bible—-why else would it be suggested that individuals skip over parts? I told someone a few months ago, “You can’t study Adam and not study Jesus.

She sold a ton of records and was everywhere, and possibly flirting with being cool (Lord knows she tried – just listen to her strained pot-smoking bit she trots out on her Live From the Forum record). And while she was convincing when she sang Laura Nyro and even Carole King, when she tried singing Joe Cocker and McCartney/Lennon, she sounded hopelessly out of her league. If you want proof, listen to her honking her way through David Bowie’s “Life on Mars.” Without a clear understanding of his cryptic lyrics, she barrels through, trying to emulate what she believes “pop” singers should sound like. Her rendition of “Space Captain” is equally head-scratching: her mannered phrasing, and near-operatic delivery completely crushes that spacey ballad. And if you want a good laugh, take a quick listen to her murder “With a Little Help From My Friends,” which she inexplicably turns into a rousing showbiz pop ballad.",1274

The Court ruled that the defendant can enter such a plea “when he concludes that his interests require a guilty plea and the record strongly indicates guilt.” The Court only allowed the guilty plea with a simultaneous protestation of innocence as there was enough evidence to show that the prosecution had a strong case for a conviction, and the defendant was entering such a plea to avoid this possible sentencing. The Court went on to note that even if the defendant could have shown that he would not have entered a guilty plea “but for” the rationale of receiving a lesser sentence, the plea itself would not have been ruled invalid. As a factual basis existed that could have supported Alford’s conviction, the Supreme Court held that his guilty plea was sustainable while the defendant himself still maintained that he was not guilty.",1184

Those were great segues and kept the whole play moving along. The actors did a wonderful job acting, too. This was by far my favorite play at SF Playhouse so far. It wasn't even like a play, while I was tweeting, someone tweeted in that it sounded more like a Twilight Zone episode. It's true, I could totally see this as a story by Ray Bradbury or someone. Yet, thinking about the future, couldn't this really happen? If everyone else was getting a computer in their head and evolving, wouldn't I want to do it too? Would I risk the 30% fail rate, possible complications, and the very real danger of someone else just yanking a cord out of my brain and killing me? I think I might. I wouldn't want to be left behind. Would you?",1491

8615,"While I could not find the court’s decision (the link appears to be broken – check the source later on just in case – here) I believe the case is straightforward. Yet there are many things which we can speculate. 1.- Have Coca-Cola registered the name ‘zero’ alone? If so, then I believe that the next action will be the invalidation of the mark. 2.- If the mark zero is a combination i.e. Coca-Cola zero, then the use of the word ‘zero’ alone does not deter other business for using it, specially if the word is not distinctive enough. 3.- Is the word ‘zero’ used by Ambet identical to the one used by Coca-cola? There is the need of a global appreciation test, not just an aural assessment. For instance, are they written in the same font, or colour, or style, or is the word in combination with other words or logo? If so, the marks are not identical but similar. 4.- It is understood that Coca-Cola is using the word ‘zero’ as describing that the drink does not contain sugar and this idea just put into my mind: is Ambet using the word also as to identify beverages that are free of sugar? What about if the use of the mark is to identify drinks that are for consumers of free will or free spirit, or open minded? In this case the word zero will be distinctive for Ambet’s products and still not distinctive for Coca-Cola – an awkward moment since the sentence could backfire Coca-Cola’s intention i.e. invalidating Coca-Cola mark and opening the doors to Ambet for the protection of the same word – some will call it an unfortunate event.",1544

Steven Ebel is a tenor currently in the ROH's Jette Parker Young Artists Programme, and took on the relatively large role of Jaquino. His bleating, mosquito like buzz of a vibrato is just not at all pleasant, and his cumbersomely gangly lope means he only moves badly on stage.

Whatever it was, it shook up your expectation and presented a challenge to the taste buds that required re-categorization of beer itself. Beer can taste like this? And so begins a journey that never really ends; the discipline of appreciation. Of course, I'm using beer as the prime example, but the principle is applicable to any number of things. The things we eat, and enjoy, change and shape over the years and it does take years to appreciate certain things. Picky eaters become connoisseurs of things that their fathers couldn't threaten them to eat when they were children. This principle even applies to people, in that it requires discipline (and love) to deal with certain people we interact with on a regular basis. In fact, I would argue that love is the triumph of appreciation and enjoyment for the """"otherness"""" of others, over and above the appreciation and enjoyment for self. Those who appreciate only self are not very likeable people.",1074

The fight for women’s rights can only be fought with the collective strength of struggles waged against all forms of oppression, and not in isolation.

The doctor advised us to start by putting olive oil in Eleri's ear, in the hope that the thing would float up and out of her ear, but he made an appointment to see him the next morning if that didn't work. Well, the olive oil didn't work. So off we pop to the doctor the next morning - the doctor tried a few things, and the nurse tried washing it out with water - but still no joy! And no-one can tell what the item is - I think it looks like a tooth(!), the doctor thinks it's white with something yellow on it, and the nurse said it doesn't look as if it is round - it seems to be kind of square shaped! So, then it was a trip to the Ear Nose and Throat Department of the district general hospital. The first doctor we saw there said he thought it looked like a tooth (I had not told him that was what I thought it looked like!), then when he couldn't remove whatever it is, he wondered whether Eleri's ear drum had burst and it was that he could see so he asked his colleague to have a look. The second doctor came in and said that it is definitely a foreign body, and he thinks it is something plastic, he said it looks like a grommet, but she's not had a grommet fitted. That doctor did not think it was wise to remove it whilst Eleri is awake as it is too close to her eardrum.

9112,"Even though Stalin and the party had successfully exploited Russia nationalism during the Great Fatherland War (1941-1945) in order to save the Soviet regime and then deployed it against Jewish cultural figures and doctors in a wave of vicious anti-Semitism, before he died in 1953, the imperatives of holding a vast multinational empire together required the re-assertion of Soviet internationalism at the expense of Russian national identity. It was one thing to encourage Russian nationalism with the Germans closing in on Stalingrad, it was quite another to encourage the same for too long after 1945, with the start of the Cold War. The reasons are clear enough: if the Russians can promote their national identity, then so can Ukrainians, Volga Germans, Kazakhs, Jews and Chechens. In fact this was already happening. It is not widely known in the West that various mixtures of Ukrainian, Lithuanian and Belorussian separatists and nationalist groups waged an insurgency against the Red Army and the internal security troops of the NKVD (the precursor of the KGB) which only came to end in the 1950s. Again, it was expedient to use nationalism against the occupying Germans but it came with obvious dangers for the stability of the Soviet empire.",1252

I am then hysterical apologizing to this baby for not showing them the love the deserve and that I really do want them and that I just miss their sister.

Knowing this child is HIS. No ifs ands or buts. He has been so good about it and honestly going through all the IUI's and getting pregnant so was I. I have felt so good about it all. Knowing this was the right choice. Over the past week its not that I regret our choices because I absolutely don't. This child was so meant to come to us this way and this was the only way we could get them to us healthy. but the feelings of how will we tell them and when will we tell them? The thoughts of how will we do this again? The fear that maybe at some point Ryan will have some concerns or worries. Its been weird talking about what this baby might look like. I keep catching myself from saying things like-- Oh I pray he has your nose or butt or hair color... Whatever it might be. I fully believe this child will be a mini replica of Ryan (if its a boy). I can only imagine Ryan's little partner. There is no doubt about that. But the fear in the back of my mind is oozing out with my added pregnancy hormones. It gets exhausting and overwhelming. I would love to hear from anyone of you that might have used a sperm or even an egg donor. Did you ever have similar fears or concerns. How have you decided and when to tell your child? I don't want it to be a big deal because its not. Its very simple. Its very matter of fact. There is no other Daddy somewhere- Ryan will be the name on that birth certificate. I just don't want it to be something that later down the road when it does come out that they feel I was hiding something from them.

At that time, Gnosticism slowly re-emerged from the shadows, nudged by the French occultist Eliphas Lévi, and propelled along by Madame Blavatsky’s Theosophical Society, French neo-gnostics such as Papus and Jean Bricaud, and researchers such as G.R.S.

9267,"So after Jaisalmer we headed to Jodhpur where we saw an amazing fort that overlooks the entire city. It was a long bus ride to get there and we only had the day as we were leaving in the morning to go to Udaipur. We made the most of our time by getting up to see the fort which took a long time but was definetly worth it. We headed back around dinner time, ate, and really just headed to bed. Early in the morning we were on the road again. We didn't arrive in Udaipur until 5pm so we literally had a full day of driving. After spending so much time in the bus we headed straight out to see some of the city. We saw a major celebration that was at the centre of the city to celebrate the coming of Holi, a big event in India. We ate at a restaurant that overlooked the festival and headed back. The next day was Holi and Holi is a day where everyone celebrates and throws coloured powder at eachother. It is meant to be fun but unfotunately at times people can get overzealous and be aggressive with the event, especially when it comes to foreigners. Because of this our professors had us stay in the hotel until 3pm. It was really too bad as it is a large event that would have been amazing to see. Many people headed straight out at 3pm to see if they could catch the end of the celebration but unfortunately I was not feeling well and ended up having to stay in the hotel. The next day was our last day in Udaipur before we headed home. I was able to make up for the time lost the day before and saw a lot of the city. We took a gondala ride and boat ride to see more of the city. After we headed down to the major part of the city and ate at a bakery. We also were able to see the city palace where the royal family of Udaipur still live.",1743

9289,"As for the cast, Jennifer Lawrence owns Katniss. She’s prickly, devoted to her family, and hellbent on survival. She gives Katniss a rich emotional life without saying a single word. Her rapport and chemistry with Willow Shields, who plays a delicate, startled Prim, and Amandla Stenberg, who plays a quiet, trusting Rue, are absolutely brilliant. Josh Hutcherson’s Peeta is seemingly earnest and adaptable, while Liam Hemsworth’s briefly seen Gale is dependable and good-natured. (Two things—one, holy crow, the Hemsworth men are ridiculously attractive, and two, my audience cracked up pretty much every time we cut from the Games to Gale watching at home.) The Capitol adults are fascinating, especially Seneca Crane. The film spends some time on the actual production of the Games, as overseen by Seneca, and to see him take pride in well-crafted murder games is a special kind of horror. I should also mention Lenny Kravitz as a low-key Cinna, who, just as in the book, remains the one man who connects the deepest with Katniss, and Donald Sutherland as a calm President Snow. As we barely see in the novel, I can’t compare. And last, but certainly not least, is Stanley Tucci’s Caesar Flickerman. To quote Cleolinda Jones (…yeah, my review is essentially a “ditto” of hers), “[he] manages just the right combination of complicit, outrageous, compassionate, fake and sincere.” It’s truly an incredible amount of talent and hard work on display here, which, to be totally honest, I never expected out of an adaptation of this novel.

But a pure consciousness of the moment to recognize that zenith, as Buddha at the moment of enlightenment, I now know that I did not have. The culmination of “happiness” as in living a life of contentment and pleasure where problems ebb and flow and crises are diluted by satisfaction, I believe, is something I see most clearly when I acknowledge where I’ve been and the steps and events that were interruptions along the way.",735

And especially during the Holiday season, that phrase, “holiday” originally meant Holy Day. They’re meant to be days set aside for reflection, gratitude, and rejoicing with family and friends. And we’ve made them into a celebration of consumerism. I’m reminded of Jesus’ words when he cleared out the temple- “My Father’s house is to be a house of prayer and you’ve made it into a robber’s den.” What would happen in the temple is that Jews would come to exchange their different kinds of currency for whatever kind was neccesary to buy the animal required for their sacrifice. And what the money changers would do is cheat the poor who came in to exchange their money. It’d be like if today you went to Canada and wanted to exchange 60 American dollars- according to the exchange rate they should give you $100 Canadian in exchange. But now imagine if they gave you $30 Canadian instead. That’s what the money lenders would do. In one sense, they’re far more brazen about their greed than we are. It’s not as if we’re taking money directly from a poor single mother in the Sudan, but in another sense, we’re no different from the money lenders.",1363

Since the film does not take itself very seriously--David Marcus’ death is glossed over, for heaven’s sake--so I cannot analyze it too harshly, either. It is good to see a Trek story that does not resort to phasors and photon torpedoes to resolve a conflict as most of them do. For that, TVH gets kudos simply for being unique. It is a good time, but it is barely Trek. It was a big hit, but still not as good as a couple other entries in the franchise.",617

No, my mind constantly returns to their horrific existence, and most frequently it does this when I’m alone. (You want to know the real reason I still live at home? There it is. I am afraid to be alone.) The slime monster in Phantoms had devoured its victims by spraying them with corrosive acid. My imagination drifted again as I thought about the phrase “corrosive acid.” I pictured myself caught unawares, face contorted in terror as a slimy oozy terrifying THING descended upon me. Would it eat my hands first, to prevent me scraping it off, I wondered. Or would it immediately dissolve my face, burning me horribly and destroying my gorgeousness?

This is where the story really comes into its own, and where Stedman’s talent as a storyteller comes to the forefront. As a reader you are torn between Izzy, the woman who has longed to be a mother for many years, and has constantly fought a losing battle against mother nature’s determination for it not to be, and then you have Hannah, the woman who has lost her husband and her child, and who the entire town thinks is crazy because she believes they will return to her. If you knew this woman’s child was alive, but was loved very much by another, what would you do? Stedman forces you as a reader to address some important questions about humanity, and makes you constantly switch between sides. One minute you’re rooting for Izzy, the next you’re rooting for Hannah. But how long can something like this stay secret? Especially when Tom’s conscience is weighing him down; forcing him to put the life of another woman before his wife and her needs.",1148

The scope of inventions removed from the state of art is much broader than that of the EPC. Section 102(b) removes two classes of disclosed inventions from the state of art. The first class includes inventions which are disclosed by an inventor, joint inventor, or a third party who obtained the invention directly or indirectly from the inventor.

9818,"Kenyan society pays a high price for our narrow perspective of leadership. We are failing to see the many ways that women are already contributing to the leadership of the country and doing so in earthshattering ways. For example, it is our narrow perspective on leadership that caused us to fail to recognize the tremendously transformative work of Prof. Wangari Maathai. Why did it take Kenyans so long to recognize and celebrate what the rest of the world already saw of our heroine’s work? What more could she have contributed to society had we embraced her early and deeply and given her the space to freely give of her all gifts to Kenya? We are failing to recognize the leadership of women like Ory Okolloh, one of the co-founders of the internationally recognized Ushahidi platform who now heads policy and government relations for Google in Africa. There are the Weaving Women, the collection of women artists, academics, writers and thinkers behind an exploration of the cultural image of ‘Wanjiku’ in representing the ‘average’ Kenyan citizen. This group of women is generating valuable new knowledge, indigenous knowledge, on the political and social systems of gender power in Kenya. Sadly, in our obsession with politicians, we are failing to see the ways these multidisciplinary women are innovative leaders. How many other Okollohs and Prof. Maathais remain untapped. Which other human resources, talented and dedicated Kenyan women of substance, is the country not benefiting from? Why do we continue with this wanton waste of potential?",1554

But a distinction has to be made between delay that is caused by having good laws in place and delays that are caused by the process itself, Page said. “I don’t think anyone would disagree that you need as efficient a process as possible but that’s completely different than speeding environmental processes by lowering the standards,” he said. “That’s what we think they are really talking about.” Putting a set timeline on a review doesn’t make sense as riskier projects should take longer to review, Page said. …",1017

FARC, as an example, started out as a Marxist/Communist terror group in Colombia and is one of the oldest terror organizations around. In the 1980's it started picking up the Enforcer role for some of the drug cartels to ensure supply via terrorism applied to local communities, and when the cartels started to crumble FARC picked up on narco-terrorism as its main methodology. Unfortunately that is no longer even close to being in the Marxist/Communist realm and FARC graduated from ideologically based terrorism to become a narco-terrorist organization which was also capitalist in its means. FARC stopped being about anything, save for money and power. The secretive Shining Path, on the other hand, continues its smoldering and pretty useless terror campaign by remaining ideologically pure. The various Red organizations of the 1970's that dabbled in terror started out from a few, central terror organizations, but then had internal ideological disputes so that Red factions and Red groups and militant interior designers all started to show up on the terror landscape. Hezbollah remains largely an arm of the Iranian regime, but now has large external support bases so that it can work in ways that can often be at cross-purposes to Iran. The PLO factionated when it sought to become semi-legitimate and some of its virulent off-shoots went out on their own and some allied with HAMAS, the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood solves this, to a degree, by spinning off new terror organization (Tunisia, Algeria, HAMAS, al Qaeda) but finds that some of these don't really work to the overall benefit of the MB.

There will be a demographic that likes the crass or in your face at times, if every thing (including speech – remember free speech and those who don’t want to hear expletives can boycott the channel, only a dictatorship would write laws or penalise for free speech . . . ) is gentrified including use of ‘harsh language’ what will happen to America’s democratic tradition? This is free speech being stopped here! If they want to offend some listeners, those listeners will just change channels and be matured enough to accept their ‘practices’ much like Burkha wearers (where France totally fail . . . did France lose that sense of Liberty which the Statue of Liberty represents? Giving (America) a symbol of Liberty does not mean liberty ends back home (in France) . . . ).

9951,"Much of the action takes place at the psychological level. The book starts with the main hero, Chris, who was in (way) Upstate New York at the time of the first major outbreak finally returning to his home town in England looking for any remnants of his family and friends. There is some obvious tension between them, and then we flash back to his immediate doings before he arrived. It is this one year precursor period that is our primary timeline, and we work our way through it until we catch back up to the beginning scenes of the novel. Throughout the novel their are flashbacks to the extreme difficulties that Chris had in trying to make it home to England. Flashbacks within a flashback sounds confusing, but it works reasonably well.",743

Before that, there had been much pulling by various people of my toes and heel with the result that the outside edge of my left heel has, ever since, been painful when I stand on it in my bare feet, though not when I wear shoes. But it has now started to occasionally be painful in shoes, too, so I guess I will have to go to my GP and maybe try to get it X-rayed.

Romney is intrigued by a Fair Tax (a national sales or consumption tax of 25-30%), but he is reluctant to endorse something so revolutionary because of critical uncertainties – such as whether people quit buying things just to avoid taxes. At a minimum, he would want to structure the tax to avoid a windfall to the rich and a hit to the middle class. Romney hates a value-added tax because he thinks government would use it to supplement its income instead of using it to eliminate the income tax. (Indeed, as I write this note, it appears the Democrats are planning that.) Romney’s preferred tax plan would be to simplify the code, eliminate taxes on middle-class savings, and consolidate corporate and individual taxes on the same money.",821
