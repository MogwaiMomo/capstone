As he was quick to point out, President and Mrs. Obama reported income of approximately $790,000 on which they paid an effective tax rate of 20.5 percent or $162,000. Their charitable contributions of $172,000, mainly to Fisher House Foundation which provides scholarships to veteran's children, did reduce their tax bill as noted by Frank in his column. I searched in vain for Frank's analysis of taxes paid by the Republican Presidential candidate Mitt More Money but maybe there was no such analysis because the Romney family did not file a return and instead filed for an extension. Now, there is nothing wrong with doing that, I guess, but Frank could have looked at Mr. Romney's 2010 tax return, disclosed earlier this year after much criticism was leveled on Mr. Romney's reticence in revealing this information. Frank would have found that Mitt paid an effective rate of 14 percent on his $27 million of income holding many millions of dollars in a Swiss bank account and in partnerships in the Cayman Islands. By the way, the 14% rate is what family's earning $80,000 usually pay. Also Frank would have noted that the Romney family paid only one tenth of 1 percent of their income in payroll taxes while the average wage earner in the United States pays 6 percent of their income on these taxes. By the way, the Romneys' charitable contributions are mainly made to the Mormon Church."

In next week's STAR TRIBUNE webcast, I'll opine about Romney possibly not paying attention to over-confidence in previous presidential campaigns. The most classic, in my opinion, was New York Goevernor Thomas E. Dewey's 1948 bid for the White House against incumbent President Harry Truman. I remember Mr. Dewey's over-confidence boiling over during the last few days of the campaign. I also remember The Chicago Tribune's infamous front page headline the morning after the election, in its earliest editions: DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN. Regardless of politics, it was fun to see the newly-elected President Truman holding up that newspaper with it's erroneous and presumptuous headline, smiling as broadly as anyone could, and justifiably so. Mr. Romney, although certain to be the Republican nominee, hands down, might still want to be a bit more humble regarding his presumptive win."

They would have consumers believe that unless oil rebounds immediately to a profitability point of $75 a barrel the industry will suffer, exploration will cease, and supplies will be thin once demand picks up. I'm all for companies making money. But since September of 2007 crude prices have averaged just about $106 a barrel. Since oil began to sag on the world markets in October the running average since September 2007 is still $99 a barrel. And even if prices were to continue at a level of $45 a barrel for the next 12 months, the average would still be at the magic price of $75 a barrel. This happens to be a down cycle for oil. But it's hardly the calamity that oil companies would have us believe. I see no legitimate business reason why there should be any concern until the average price dips below $75 a barrel. By my calculations that will be at least a year away under the worst of circumstances. Until then I would hope that oil companies will do what all companies should do. Dip into profits earned during the good times and continue to do business. The price will rebound in time. But I doubt that Americans will be too happy if exploration and investment cease while oil companies sit on those huge profits thereby causing another shortage and an inflated return to $140 oil."

10113,"15. Mark Wilson, United States -- Having already played 12 tournaments on the PGA Tour this season, Wilson is taking a well deserved two weeks off and will be back for the Wells Fargo Championship next week before heading to the Players Championship. He skipped the Valero Texas Open last week, no real surprise because he has missed the cut in three of his last four appearances in the tournament after finishing solo fourth in 2004. … The 37-year-old Wilson labored on the PGA Tour for a decade before he earned his first victory, in the 2007 Honda Classic. However, in the last few years he has established himself as one of the better players in the game with four victories since late 2009. Mark was one of seven two-time winners on the PGA Tour last season, and his victory at the Humana Challenge early this year has made him one of four players who have won twice on the circuit since the beginning of last year. The others are Luke Donald, Steve Stricker and Bubba Watson -- pretty good company for a guy considered by most to be a journeyman. … Wilson finished 11th on the regular-season FedEx Cup points list last season and is ninth this year. However, the list he is most interested in is the U.S. Ryder Cup points list. He ranks 11th -- the top eight earning automatic berths on the U.S. team for the matches in September at Medinah -- and he will need a strong summer to earn a spot in one of the team events for the first time."
